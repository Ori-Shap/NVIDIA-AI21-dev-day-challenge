# Item 8.01. Other Events.

On May 18, 2022, in light of Matthew McKenna's retirement, the Board designated Ms. Nicosia as the "audit committee financial expert." In connection with this designation, the Board determined that Ms. Nicosia qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert," as defined by the rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), because of her relevant experience as president of an operating unit of a large multinational corporation. She has supervised the finance and accounting professionals responsible for, and personally analyzed and evaluated, financial statements, as well as internal controls over financial reporting. She is also familiar with audit committee functions through her service on the Company's Audit Committee. The Board also believes that there are other directors who would also qualify for this designation.
