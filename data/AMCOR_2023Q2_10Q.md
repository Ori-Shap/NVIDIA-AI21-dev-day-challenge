# [Cautionary Statement Regarding]{.underline} [Forward-Looking]{.underline} [Statements]{.underline}

Unless otherwise indicated, references to \"Amcor,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" and \"us\" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refer to Amcor plc and its consolidated subsidiaries.

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain statements that are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are generally identified with words like \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"target,\" \"project,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"approximately,\" \"possible,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"anticipate,\" \"commit,\" \"estimate,\" \"potential,\" \"ambitions,\" \"outlook,\" or \"continue,\" the negative of these words, other terms of similar meaning, or the use of future dates. Such statements are based on the current expectations of the management of Amcor and are qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of risks and uncertainties. None of Amcor or any of its respective directors, executive officers, or advisors, provide any representation, assurance, or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements will actually occur. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from expectations include, but are not limited to:

-   changes in consumer demand patterns and customer requirements in numerous industries;

-   the loss of key customers, a reduction in their production requirements, or consolidation among key customers;

-   significant competition in the industries and regions in which we operate;

-   the inability to expand our current business effectively through either organic growth, including by product innovation, or acquisitions;

-   challenging current and future global economic conditions, including inflation and supply chain disruptions;

-   impact of operating internationally, including negative impacts from the Russia-Ukraine conflict;

-   price fluctuations or shortages in the availability of raw materials, energy and other inputs, which could adversely affect our business;

-   production, supply, and other commercial risks, including counterparty credit risks, which may be exacerbated in times of economic volatility;

-   global health outbreaks, including the Coronavirus pandemic (\"COVID-19\");

-   an inability to attract and retain key personnel;

-   costs and liabilities related to current and future environment, health and safety laws and regulations;

-   labor disputes;

-   risks related to climate change;

-   failures or disruptions in information technology systems;

-   cybersecurity risks, which could disrupt our operations or risk of loss of our sensitive business information;

-   a significant increase in our indebtedness or a downgrade in our credit rating could reduce our operating flexibility and increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations;

-   foreign exchange rate risk;

-   rising interest rates that increase our borrowing costs on our variable rate indebtedness and could have other negative impacts;

-   a significant write-down of goodwill and/or other intangible assets;

-   failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting;

-   an inability of our insurance policies, including our use of a captive insurance company, to provide adequate protection against all of the risks we face;

-   an inability to defend our intellectual property rights or intellectual property infringement claims against us;

-   litigation, including product liability claims, or regulatory developments;

-   increasing scrutiny and changing expectations with respect to our Environmental, Social, and Governance (\"ESG\") practices resulting in additional costs or exposure to additional risks;

-   changing government regulations in environmental, health, and safety matters; and

-   changes in tax laws or changes in our geographic mix of earnings.

These risks and uncertainties are supplemented by those identified from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation, those described under Part I, \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, as updated by our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. You can obtain copies of Amcor's filings with the SEC for free at the SEC's website ([www.sec.gov).](http://www.sec.gov/) Forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof and Amcor does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, or any other information in this communication, as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, or to correct any inaccuracies or omissions in them which become apparent, except as expressly required by law. All forward-looking statements in this communication are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement.

**[Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements]{.underline} Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation**

Amcor plc (\"Amcor\" or the \"Company\") is a public limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey. The Company\'s history dates back more than 150 years, with origins in both Australia and the United States of America. Today, Amcor is a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal-care, and other consumer goods end markets. The Company\'s innovation excellence and global packaging expertise enable the Company to solve packaging challenges around the world every day, producing packaging that is more functional, appealing, and cost effective for its customers and their consumers and importantly, more sustainable for the environment.

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"U.S. GAAP\") for interim financial information. Consistent with these requirements, this Form 10-Q does not include all the information required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. Further, the year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data as of June 30, 2022 was derived from audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. It is management\'s opinion, however, that all material and recurring adjustments have been made that are necessary for a fair statement of its interim financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. For further information, this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in the Company\'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.

There have been no material changes to the accounting policies followed by the Company during the current fiscal year. The Company reclassified prior year inventory comparatives in the condensed consolidated balance sheets to conform to the current year\'s presentation which provides the breakdown of inventory. This change in presentation did not have an impact on the Company's financial condition or operating results. Certain amounts in the Company\'s notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements may not add or recalculate due to rounding.

# Note 2 - New Accounting Guidance Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832) that adds certain disclosure requirements for entities that receive government assistance. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2021-10 on July 1, 2022, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company\'s condensed consolidated financial statements. ASU 2021-10 may have an impact on the Company's disclosures in the future, if government assistance provided to the Company were to become material.

# Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04 that adds certain disclosure requirements for entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services. The new standard\'s requirement to disclose the key terms of supplier finance programs is effective for all interim and annual periods beginning with the Company\'s fiscal year ending June 30, 2024. The new standard does not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of supplier finance program obligations. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this new guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements.

The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs issued by the FASB. The Company determined at this time that all other ASUs not yet adopted are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on its results of operation, financial position, and disclosures.

A pre-tax net gain on disposal of the Company\'s three manufacturing facilities in Russia (\"Russian business\") of $215 million was recognized in the three and six months ended December 31, 2022, which includes a reversal of a $90 million impairment charge recorded in the quarter ended June 30, 2022. For further information, refer to Note 4, \"Held for Sale\" and Note 5, \"Acquisitions and Disposals.\"

# Note 4 - Held for Sale

During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company classified the assets and liabilities of its Russian operations as held for sale as a result of the Company\'s decision to sell its Russian business, and recorded an impairment of $90 million. On December 23, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the Russian business and derecognized the assets and liabilities previously classified as held for sale. The disposal did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company\'s operations and financial results, and therefore did not qualify for reporting as a discontinued operation. The Russian business was part of the Company\'s Flexibles reportable segment. For further information, refer to Note 5, \"Acquisitions and Disposals.\"

Major classes of assets and liabilities of the Russian business classified as held for sale were as follows:

# Note 5 - Acquisitions and Disposals

***Acquisitions***

On August 1, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% equity interest in DGPack s.r.o., a Czech Republic company that operates a world-class flexible packaging manufacturing plant. The initial purchase consideration amounted to $60 million and is subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The consideration includes $6 million that is expected to be paid in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. The acquisition is part of the Company\'s Flexibles reportable segment and resulted in the recognition of acquired identifiable net assets of $36 million and goodwill of $24 million. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired and goodwill are based on the Company\'s best estimate as of December 31, 2022 and are considered preliminary. The fair value estimates were based on income, market, and cost valuation methods. The Company aims to complete the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable but no later than one year from the date of the acquisition.

Pro forma information related to the acquisition of DGPack s.r.o. has not been presented, as the effect of the acquisition on the Company\'s consolidated financial statements was not material.

***Disposals***

On December 23, 2022, the Company completed the sale of the Russian business after receiving all necessary regulatory approvals and cash proceeds, including receipt of closing cash balances. The sale follows the Company's previously announced plan to pursue the orderly sale of its Russian business. The total net cash consideration received was $365 million and resulted in a net pre-tax net gain of $215 million, which included a reversal of a $90 million impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. The impairment charge was based on the Company\'s best estimate of the fair value of its Russian business, which considered the wide range of indicative bids received and uncertain regulatory environment. The net pre-tax gain on disposal of the Russian business was recorded as restructuring and other related activities, net within the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income. The Russian business had a net carrying value of $252 million, including allocated goodwill of $46 million and accumulated other comprehensive losses of $73 million, primarily attributed to foreign currency translation adjustments.

# Note 8 - Fair Value Measurements

The fair values of the Company\'s financial assets and financial liabilities listed below reflect the amounts that would be received to sell the assets or paid to transfer the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).

The Company\'s non-derivative financial instruments primarily include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables, short-term debt, and long-term debt. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, the carrying value of these financial instruments, excluding long-term debt, approximated fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

The carrying value of long-term debt with variable interest rates approximates its fair value. The fair value of the Company\'s long-term debt with fixed interest rates is based on market prices, if available, or expected future cash flows discounted at the current interest rate for financial liabilities with similar risk profiles.

The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt with fixed interest rates (including the effect of receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps) were as follows:

The fair value of the commodity contracts was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contracts and observed market forward prices discounted at a currency specific rate. Forward exchange contract fair values were determined based on quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets using inputs such as currency rates and forward points. The fair value of the interest rate swaps was determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market based swap yield curves, taking into account current interest rates.

Contingent purchase consideration liabilities arise from business acquisitions. As of December 31, 2022, the Company\'s contingent purchase consideration liabilities consisted of a $9 million liability that is contingent on future royalty income generated by Discma AG, a subsidiary acquired in March 2017, and a $6 million balance relating to consideration for small business acquisitions where payments are contingent on the Company vacating a certain property or performance criteria. The fair value of the contingent purchase consideration liabilities was determined for each arrangement individually. The fair value was determined using the income approach with significant inputs that are not observable in the market. Key assumptions include the discount rates consistent with the level of risk of achievement and probability adjusted financial projections. The expected outcomes are recorded at net present value, which requires adjustment over the life for changes in risks and probabilities. Changes arising from modifications in forecasts related to contingent consideration are expected to be immaterial.

The fair value of contingent purchase consideration liabilities is included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

# Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

In addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company records assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring fair value measurements are considered to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.

As further discussed in Note 4, \"Held for Sale\" during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company met the criteria to recognize the Russian business as held for sale which resulted in the Company remeasuring the disposal group at its fair value, less cost to sell, which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. The Company completed the disposal of its Russian business in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 and as of December 31, 2022, the Company\'s other assets and liabilities held for sale are immaterial. Refer to Note 4, \"Held for Sale\" for further information.

Following a commitment to sell non-core assets during the three and six months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an expense of $9 million, predominantly to adjust the long-lived assets to their fair value less cost to sell

as determined in reference to the selling price in the signed sale and purchase agreement. During the six months ended December 31, 2021, long- lived assets with a carrying value of $12 million were written down to a fair value of zero as the Company\'s Durban, South Africa, manufacturing facility was destroyed in a fire as the result of general civil unrest. In addition, other long-lived assets in South Africa, with a carrying amount of

$8 million, were written down to their estimated fair value of $4 million using level 3 inputs. These expenses are included within other income, net in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income.

The Company tests indefinite-lived intangibles, including goodwill, for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. These nonrecurring fair value measurements are considered to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, there were no impairment charges recorded on indefinite-lived intangibles, including goodwill.

# Note 9 - Derivative Instruments

The Company periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate, commodity price, and currency risks. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. For hedges that meet the hedge accounting criteria, the Company, at inception, formally designates and documents the instruments as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge of a specific underlying exposure. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses and documents that its hedges have been and are expected to continue to be highly effective.

# Interest Rate Risk

The Company\'s policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, monitoring global interest rates, and, where appropriate, hedging floating interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, and interest rate locks. For interest rate swaps that are accounted for as fair value hedges, the gains and losses related to the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest expense and offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market interest rates. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that have not been designated as hedging instruments are reported in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income in other income, net.

During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, the Company entered into interest rate swap contracts for a total notional amount of

$1.25 billion. Under the terms of the contracts, the Company pays a weighted-average fixed rate of interest of 4.53% and receives a variable rate of interest, based on compound overnight SOFR, for the period from November 2022 through June 2023, settled monthly. As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, the total notional amounts of such receive-variable/pay-fixed interest rate swaps were $1.25 billion and zero, respectively. Although the Company is not applying hedge accounting, the Company believes that these economic hedging instruments are effective in protecting the Company against the risks of changes in the variable interest rate on a portion of its forecasted commercial paper issuances.

As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, the total notional amount of the Company's receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges of certain of the Company\'s term debt was $650 million.

# Foreign Currency Risk

The Company manufactures and sells its products and finances operations in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. The purpose of the Company\'s foreign currency hedging program is to manage the volatility associated with the changes in exchange rates.

To manage this exchange rate risk, the Company utilizes forward contracts. Contracts that qualify for hedge accounting are designated as cash flow hedges of certain forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss (\"AOCI\") and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion is recognized in earnings over the life of the hedging relationship in the same consolidated statements of income line item as the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of forward contracts that have not been designated as hedging instruments are reported in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income.

As of December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022, the notional amount of the outstanding forward contracts was $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.

# Commodity Risk

Certain raw materials used in the Company\'s production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables, and other unpredictable factors. The Company\'s policy is to minimize exposure to price volatility by passing through the commodity price risk to customers, including the use of fixed price swaps.

In some cases, the Company purchases, on behalf of customers, fixed price commodity swaps to offset the exposure of price volatility on the underlying sales contracts. These instruments are cash closed out on maturity and the related cost or benefit is passed through to customers.

Information about commodity price exposure is derived from supply forecasts submitted by customers and these exposures are hedged by central treasury units. Changes in the fair value of commodity hedges are

20

recognized in AOCI. The cumulative amount of the hedge is recognized in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income when the forecasted transaction is realized.

The Company had the following outstanding commodity contracts to hedge forecasted purchases:

On October 12, 2021, the Company contracted with Pacific Life Insurance Company to purchase a group annuity contract and to transfer

$186 million of its pension plan assets and related benefit obligations. This transaction required a remeasurement of the pension plan assets and obligations and resulted in the recognition of a $3 million non-cash pension settlement loss in the three and six months ended December 31, 2021.

# Note 11 - Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is based on the Company's estimated annual effective tax rate for the respective fiscal years, and is applied on income before income taxes, and adjusted for specific items that are required to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred.

The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by 14.3 percentage points compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021 from 21.0% to 6.7%, primarily due to differences in the income mix, including higher non-taxable income in the current period, and the difference in magnitude of discrete events in both periods.

The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by 10.7 percentage points compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021 from 22.3% to 11.6% due to differences in the income mix, including higher non-taxable income in the current period, and the differences in the magnitude of discrete events in both periods.

The Company\'s employee share plans require the delivery of shares to employees in the future when rights vest or vested options are exercised. The Company currently acquires shares on the open market to deliver shares to employees to satisfy vesting or exercising commitments. This exposes the Company to market price risk.

To manage the market price risk, the Company has entered into forward contracts for the purchase of its ordinary shares. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had forward contracts outstanding that mature between March 2023 and May 2023 to purchase 10 million shares at a weighted average price of $12.38. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had forward contracts outstanding that mature between November 2022 and June 2023 to purchase 14 million shares at a weighted average price of $12.67. During the six months ended December 31, 2022, forward contracts related to 11 million shares were settled, which were outstanding as of June 30, 2022.

The forward contracts to purchase the Company\'s own shares are classified as a current liability. Equity is reduced by an amount equal to the fair value of the shares at inception. The carrying value of the forward contracts at each reporting period was determined based on the present value of the cost required to settle the contracts.

# Note 14 - Earnings Per Share Computations

The Company applies the two-class method when computing its earnings per share (\"EPS\"), which requires that net income per share for each class of share be calculated assuming all of the Company\'s net income is distributed as dividends to each class of share based on their contractual rights.

Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding after excluding the ordinary shares to be repurchased using forward contracts. Diluted EPS includes the effects of share options, restricted shares, performance rights, performance shares, and share rights, if dilutive.

# Note 15 - Contingencies and Legal Proceedings Contingencies - Brazil

The Company\'s operations in Brazil are involved in various governmental assessments and litigation, principally related to claims for excise and income taxes. The Company vigorously defends its positions and believes it will prevail on most, if not all, of these matters. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact the Company\'s consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Under customary local regulations, the Company\'s Brazilian subsidiaries may need to post cash or other collateral if a challenge to any administrative assessment proceeds to the Brazilian court system; however, the level of cash or collateral already pledged or potentially required to be pledged would not significantly impact the Company\'s liquidity. At December 31, 2022, the Company had recorded accruals of $12 million, included in other non-current liabilities. The Company has estimated a reasonably possible loss exposure in excess of the accrual of $21 million at December 31, 2022. The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters cannot be accurately predicted. The Company routinely assesses these matters as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records the best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where the likelihood of an ultimate loss is probable. The Company\'s assessments are based on its knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any of these matters may differ from the Company\'s estimates.

As of December 31, 2022, the Company has provided letters of credit of $37 million, judicial insurance of $1 million, and deposited cash of

$12 million with the courts to continue to defend the cases.

# Contingencies - Environmental Matters

The Company, along with others, has been identified as a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\") at several waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and regulations and may face potentially material environmental remediation obligations. While the Company benefits from various forms of insurance policies, actual coverage may not, or only partially, cover the total potential exposures. At December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded $17 million of aggregate accruals for its share of estimated future remediation costs at these sites.

In addition to the matters described above, at December 31, 2022, the Company has also recorded aggregate accruals of $42 million for potential liabilities for remediation obligations at various worldwide locations that are owned or operated by the Company, or were formerly owned or operated.

The SEC requires the Company to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state, or local environmental provisions if the Company reasonably believes that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. The Company uses a threshold of $1 million or more for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. Applying this threshold, there are no environmental matters required to be disclosed for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022.

While the Company believes that its accruals are adequate to cover its future obligations, there can be no assurance that the ultimate payments will not exceed the accrued amounts. Nevertheless, based on the available information, the Company does not believe that its potential environmental obligations will have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition.

# Other Matters

In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims. While the potential financial impact with respect to these ordinary course matters is subject to many factors and uncertainties, management believes that any financial impact to the Company from these matters, individually and in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition.

# Note 16 - Subsequent Events

On January 16, 2023, the Company announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire a medical device packaging company based in Shanghai, China, which generates annual sales of approximately $50 million. The acquisition is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2023.

On February 7, 2023, the Company\'s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.1225 per share to be paid on March 21, 2023 to shareholders of record as of March 1, 2023. Amcor has received a waiver from the Australian Securities Exchange (\"ASX\") settlement operating rules, which will allow Amcor to defer processing conversions between ordinary share and CHESS Depositary Instrument (\"CDI\") registers from February 28, 2023 to March 1, 2023, inclusive.

On February 7, 2023, the Company\'s Board of Directors approved a buyback of up to $100 million of ordinary shares and/or CHESS Depositary Instruments (\"CDIs\") in the following twelve months.

# Overview

Amcor is a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal- care, and other products. We work with leading companies around the world to protect their products and the people who rely on them, differentiate brands, and improve supply chains through a range of flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, closures, and services. We are focused on making packaging that is increasingly light-weighted, recyclable and reusable, and made using an increasing amount of recycled content. During fiscal year 2022, Amcor generated $14.5 billion in net sales.

# Significant Items Affecting the Periods Presented

***Raw Material, Inflation, and Supply Chain Trends***

During the first half of fiscal year 2023, we continued to experience intermittent supply shortages and price volatility of certain resins and raw materials as a result of market dynamics and higher rates of inflation impacting energy, fuel, and labor costs. In addition, higher inflation, especially in Europe and the United States, has led central banks to rapidly raise interest rates to dampen inflation which results in higher interest expense on our variable rate debt. The underlying causes for the continued volatility can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the ongoing regional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in labor shortages and transportation constraints, energy shortages and the ongoing impacts of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions which are tied to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. We will continue to work closely with our suppliers and customers, leveraging our global capabilities and expertise to work through supply chain disruptions and other resulting issues. In addition, we are focused on driving costs out of our business in this challenging environment and recovering higher raw material costs to help mitigate inflation. However, there could be a time lag between recognizing the benefit of our mitigating actions and when the inflation occurs, and there is no assurance that our mitigating measures will be able to fully mitigate the impact of ongoing inflation.

***Impact of COVID-19***

We continue to monitor the impact of the ongoing 2019 Novel Coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic on all aspects of our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in intermittent regional government restrictions on the movement of people, goods, and non-essential services resulting in a period of historic uncertainty and challenges. We remain focused on our commitment to the health and safety of our employees as our first priority. We expect to continue to evaluate our response and related precautions until the COVID-19 pandemic has been fully resolved as a public health crisis.

There are currently no significant COVID-19 related restrictions on our business, with China relaxing controls and eliminating lockdowns in December 2022. Lockdowns in the first half of fiscal year 2023 did impact demand for our products in China and significant increases in

COVID-19 infections may continue to impact demand for our products and lead to supply chain disruptions and other challenges. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our facilities have largely been exempt from government mandated closure orders and while governmental measures may be modified, we expect that our facilities will remain operational given the essential products we supply. However, despite our best efforts to contain the impact in our facilities, it remains possible that significant disruptions could occur as a result of the pandemic, including temporary closures of our facilities due to outbreaks of the virus among our workforce or government mandates.

We continue to believe we are well-positioned to meet the challenges of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and currently do not expect a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. However, the ultimate near-term impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on the extent and nature of any future disruptions across the supply chain, the implementation of further social distancing measures and other government-imposed restrictions, as well as the nature and pace of macroeconomic recovery in key global economies.

***Russia and Ukraine Conflict***

Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine that began in February 2022 continues as of the date of the filing of this quarterly report. In advance of the invasion, we proactively suspended operations at our small manufacturing site in Ukraine. We also operated three manufacturing facilities in Russia until their sale on December 23, 2022, for net cash proceeds of $365 million. In addition, the Company repatriated approximately $65 million in cash held in Russia as part of the transaction. The pre-tax net gain on sale of $215 million includes the reversal of a pre-tax $90 million impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 to adjust the Russian business to its estimated fair value less cost to sell. We expect to invest $110 million to

34

$130 million of the cash received in a range of additional initiatives to partly offset divested earnings. Of the remaining cash received, we plan to repurchase up to $100 million in additional shares and use the balance to reduce net debt.

The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted the global economy and has the potential to result in continued supply chain disruptions and significant inflationary pressure on raw material prices and the cost and supply of other resources (such as energy and natural gas).

For further information, refer to Note 4, \"Held for Sale,\" Note 5, \"Acquisitions and Disposals,\" Note 6, \"Restructuring,\" and Note 16, \"Subsequent Events\" of \"Part I, Item 1, Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\"

***Highly Inflationary Accounting***

We have subsidiaries in Argentina that historically had a functional currency of the Argentine Peso. As of June 30, 2018, the Argentine economy has been designated as highly inflationary for accounting purposes. Accordingly, beginning July 1, 2018, we began reporting the financial results of our Argentine subsidiaries with a functional currency of the Argentine Peso at the functional currency of the parent, which is the U.S. dollar. Highly inflationary accounting in the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 resulted in a negative impact of

$5 million and $2 million, respectively, and $13 million and $4 million in the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in foreign currency transaction losses that was reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income.

The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by 14.3 percentage points compared to the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to differences in the income mix, including higher non-taxable income in the current period, and the difference in magnitude of discrete events in both periods.

The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2022 decreased by 10.7 percentage points compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to differences in the income mix, including higher non-taxable income in the current period, and the difference in magnitude of discrete events in both periods.

# Presentation of Non-GAAP Information

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refers to non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (\"Adjusted EBIT\"), earnings before interest and tax (\"EBIT\"), adjusted net income, and net debt. Such measures have not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). These non-GAAP financial measures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable. These measures exclude the impact of significant tax reforms, certain amounts related to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, acquisitions, and restructuring, including employee-related costs, equipment relocation costs, accelerated depreciation, and the write-down of equipment. These measures also exclude gains or losses on sales of significant property and divestitures, significant property and other impairments, net of insurance recovery, certain litigation matters, significant pension settlements, impairments in goodwill and equity method investments, and certain acquisition-related expenses, including transaction expenses, due diligence expenses, professional and legal fees, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory, order backlog, intangible amortization, changes in the fair value of deferred acquisition payments and economic hedging instruments on commercial paper, and impacts related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use the non- GAAP measures to evaluate operating performance and believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors and other external parties to perform comparisons of our current and historical performance.

# New Accounting Pronouncements

Refer to Note 2, \"New Accounting Guidance,\" in \"Item 1. Financial Statements - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\"

# Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. These critical accounting estimates are discussed in detail in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgments" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. There have been no material changes in critical accounting estimates and judgments as of December 31, 2022 from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022.

# Liquidity and Capital Resources

We finance our business primarily through cash flows provided by operating activities, borrowings from banks, and proceeds from issuances of debt and equity. We periodically review our capital structure and liquidity position in light of market conditions, expected future cash flows, potential funding requirements for debt refinancing, capital expenditures and acquisitions, the cost of capital, sensitivity analyses reflecting downside scenarios, the impact on our financial metrics and credit ratings, and our ease of access to funding sources.

The COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions have not materially impacted our liquidity position, current and expected cash flows from operating activities, or available cash. We believe that our cash flows provided by operating activities, together with borrowings available under our credit facilities and access to the commercial paper market, backstopped by our bank debt facilities, will continue to provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, capital expenditures, and other commitments, including dividends and purchases of our ordinary shares and CHESS Depositary Instruments under authorized share repurchase programs, into the foreseeable future.

+-----------------------------------------------------+----------+--------+----------+---------+

*Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities*

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $178 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash flow is primarily driven by higher working capital outflows in the current period.

*Net Cash (Used in)/Provided by Investing Activities*

Net cash used in/provided by investing activities increased by $289 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The increase is mainly driven by the disposal proceeds collected from the sale of the Russian business in the current period, partially offset by the acquisition of DGPack s.r.o. and additional investments in affiliated companies.

*Net Cash Used in Financing Activities*

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $145 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022, compared to the six months ended December 31, 2021. The change is primarily due to lower share buybacks compared to the prior period, partially offset by lower net debt drawdowns compared to the prior period.

***Net Debt***

We borrow from financial institutions and debt investors in the form of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes, and commercial paper. We have a mixture of fixed and floating interest rates and use interest rate swaps to provide further flexibility in managing the interest cost of borrowings. At the end of October 2022, we entered into interest rate swap contracts for a total notional amount of $1.25 billion. Under the terms of the contracts, we will pay a weighted average fixed rate of interest of 4.53% and receive a variable rate of interest, based on compound overnight SOFR, for the period from November 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023, settled monthly. The interest rate swap contracts economically hedge the SOFR component of $1.25 billion of ongoing USD commercial paper issuances at 4.53%.

Short-term debt consists of bank debt with a duration of less than 12 months and bank overdrafts which are classified as current due to the short-term nature of the borrowings, except where we have the ability and intent to refinance and as such extend the debt beyond 12 months. The current portion of long-term debt consists of debt amounts repayable within a year after the balance sheet date.

47

Our primary bank debt facilities and notes are unsecured and subject to negative pledge arrangements limiting the amount of secured indebtedness we can incur to 10.0% of our total tangible assets, subject to some exceptions and variations by facility. In addition, the covenants of the bank debt facilities require us to maintain a leverage ratio not higher than 3.9 times. The negative pledge arrangements and the financial covenants are defined in the related debt agreements. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under our bank debt facilities.

Our net debt as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 was $6.1 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively.

***Available Financing***

As of December 31, 2022, we had undrawn credit facilities available in the amount of $0.9 billion. Our senior facilities are available to fund working capital, growth capital expenditures, and refinancing obligations and are provided to us by two bank syndicates. These facilities mature in April 2025 and April 2027, respectively, and the revolving tranches have two 12-month options available to management to extend the maturity date. Subject to certain conditions, we can request the total commitment level under each agreement to be increased by up to $500 million.

As of December 31, 2022, the revolving senior bank debt facilities had an aggregate limit of $3.8 billion, of which $2.9 billion had been drawn (inclusive of amounts drawn under commercial paper programs reducing the overall balance of available senior facilities).

***Dividend Payments***

We declared and paid a $0.12 cash dividend per ordinary share during the first fiscal quarter that ended September 30, 2022, and a $0.1225 cash dividend per ordinary share during the second fiscal quarter that ended December 31, 2022.

***Credit Rating***

Our capital structure and financial practices have earned us investment grade credit ratings from two internationally recognized credit rating agencies. These investment grade credit ratings are important to our ability to issue debt at favorable rates of interest, for various terms, and from a diverse range of markets that are highly liquid, including European and U.S. debt capital markets, and from global financial institutions.

***Share Repurchases***

On August 17, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $400 million buyback of ordinary shares and/or CHESS Depositary Instruments (\"CDIs\"). During the six months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately $40 million of ordinary shares and CDIs in the aggregate, including transaction costs, or 3 million shares. The shares repurchased as part of the program were canceled upon repurchase. Further, on February 7, 2023, our Board of Directors approved an additional buyback of up to $100 million of ordinary shares and/or CHESS Depositary Instruments (\"CDIs\") in the following twelve months.

We had cash outflows of $221 million and $133 million for the purchase of our shares in the open market and using forward contracts to purchase our own equity during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as treasury shares to satisfy the vesting and exercises of share-based compensation awards. As of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, we held treasury shares at a cost of $18 million, representing 2 million shares.

# [Item 4. Controls and Procedures]{.underline}

***Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures***

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. The term \"disclosure controls and procedures,\" as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC\'s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022.

***Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting***

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
