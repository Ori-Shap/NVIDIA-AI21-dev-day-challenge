**AMOUNTS AND TERMS OF THE ADVANCES**

### Section 2.01 [The Advances]{.underline}.

Each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, to make Advances in Dollars and/or Euros to the Company and any Borrowing Subsidiary from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the Effective Date until the Termination Date in an aggregate amount (based in respect of any Advances to be denominated in Euros by reference to the Equivalent thereof in Dollars determined on the date of delivery of the applicable Notice of Borrowing) not to exceed at any time outstanding such Lender's Commitment. Each Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount of the Borrowing Minimum or an integral multiple of the Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof and shall consist of Advances of the same Type and in the same currency made on the same day by the Lenders ratably according to their respective Commitments. Within the limits of each Lender's Commitment, each Borrower may borrow under this Section 2.01, prepay pursuant to Section 2.10 and reborrow under this Section 2.01.

14

### Section 2.02 [Making]{.underline} [the Advances]{.underline}.

(a) Each Borrowing shall be made on notice, given not later than (x) 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third U.S. Government Securities Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Term SOFR Advances, (y) 4:00 P.M. (London time) on the third Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Eurocurrency Rate Advances or (z) 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date of the proposed Borrowing in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Base Rate Advances, by the Company (on its own behalf and on behalf of any Borrowing Subsidiary) to the Agent, which shall give to each Lender prompt notice thereof by telecopier or email. Each such notice of a Borrowing (a "[Notice of Borrowing]{.underline}") shall be by e-mail, confirmed promptly in writing, in substantially the form of Exhibit B hereto, specifying therein the requested (i) date of such Borrowing, (ii) Type of Advances constituting such Borrowing, (iii) aggregate amount of such Borrowing, (iv) in the case of a Borrowing consisting of Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the currency and initial Interest Period for each such Advance and (v) name of the relevant Borrower (which shall be the Company or a Borrowing Subsidiary). Each Lender shall, before 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the date of such Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent at the applicable Agent's Account, in same day funds, such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing. After the Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Agent will make such same day funds available to the relevant Borrower at such Borrower's account at the Agent's address referred to in Section 8.02.

(b) Anything in subsection (a) above to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) the Company may not select Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances for any Borrowing if the aggregate amount of such Borrowing is less than the Borrowing Minimum or if the obligation of the Lenders to make Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, as applicable, shall then be suspended pursuant to Section 2.08 or 2.12 and (ii) the Term SOFR Advances and Eurocurrency Rate Advances may not be outstanding as part of more than twelve separate Borrowings.

(c) Each Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the relevant Borrower. In the case of any Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the Company shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure by the applicable Borrower to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing for such Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Borrowing when such Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

15

(d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Agent, such Lender and such Borrower severally agree to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at (i) in the case of a Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Advances comprising such Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Lender, (A) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (B) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Euros. If such Lender shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender's Advance as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement and shall be made available in same day funds to the relevant Borrower's account at the Agent's address referred to in Section 8.02.

(e) The failure of any Lender to make the Advance to be made by it as part of any Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Advance on the date of such Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Borrowing.

### Section 2.03 \[[Reserved]{.underline}\].

**Section 2.04 [Fees]{.underline}.**

(a) [Commitment Fee]{.underline}. The Company agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee on the aggregate amount of such Lender's unused portion of the Commitment from the Effective Date in the case of each Initial Lender and from the effective date specified in the Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which it became a Lender in the case of each other Lender until the Termination Date (on a daily basis) at a rate per annum equal to 0.025%, payable in arrears quarterly on the last day of each June, September, December and March, commencing June 30, 2023, and on the Termination Date.

$25,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and p [rovided, further]{.underline} that the aggregate amount of the Commitments of the Lenders shall not be reduced to an amount that is less than the aggregate principal amount of the Advances then outstanding.

(b) If any Lender (i) shall make a demand under Section 2.11 or 2.14 or (ii) is a Defaulting Lender or Non-Consenting Lender, the Company shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days' notice, to terminate in full the Commitment of such Lender or to demand that such Lender assign to one or more Persons all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.07. If the Company shall elect to terminate in full the Commitment of any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.05(b), the Company shall pay to such Lender, on the effective date of such Lender's Commitment termination, an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing to such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all other amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement, whereupon such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto.

16

(c) \(i\) From time to time, the Company may propose to increase the aggregate amount of the Commitments by an aggregate amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (a "[Proposed A]{.underline}gg[regate Commitment Increase]{.underline}") in the manner set forth below, provided that:

    1.  no Default shall have occurred and be continuing either as of the applicable Increase Notice Date (as hereinafter defined) or as of the related Increase Date (as hereinafter defined); and

    2.  after giving effect to any such increase, the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall not exceed

$4,950,000,000.

(ii) From time to time the Company may request an increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments by delivering to the Agent a notice (an "[Increase Notice]{.underline}"; the date of delivery thereof to the Agent being the "[Increase Notice Date]{.underline}") specifying (1) the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, (2) the proposed date (the "[Increase Date]{.underline}") on which the Commitments would be so increased (which Increase Date may not be fewer than 30 days after the Increase Notice Date) and (3) the New Lenders, if any, to whom the Company desires to offer the opportunity to commit to all or a portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase. The Agent shall in turn promptly notify each Lender of the Company's request by sending each Lender a copy of such notice.

(iii) Not later than the date five days after the Increase Notice Date, the Agent shall notify each New Lender, if any, identified in the related Increase Notice of the opportunity to commit to all or any portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase. Each such New Lender may irrevocably commit to all or a portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase (such New Lender's "[Proposed New Commitment]{.underline}") by notifying the Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to the Company) before 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date that is 10 days after the Increase Notice Date; p [rovided]{.underline} that:

      1.  the Proposed New Commitment of each New Lender shall be in an amount not less than $25,000,000; and

      2.  each New Lender that submits a Proposed New Commitment shall enter into an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Company and the Agent pursuant to which such New Lender shall undertake a Commitment (and, if any such New Lender is already a Lender, its Commitment shall be in addition to such Lender's Commitment hereunder on such date), and shall pay to the Agent a processing and recordation fee of $3,500.

(iv) If, and only if, the aggregate Proposed New Commitments of all of the New Lenders shall be less than the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, then (unless the Company otherwise requests) the Agent shall, on or prior to the date that is 15 days after the Increase Notice Date, notify each Lender of the opportunity to so commit to all or any portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase not committed to by New Lenders pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(iii). Each Lender may, if, in its sole discretion, it elects to do so, irrevocably offer to commit to all or a portion of such remainder (such Lender's "[Proposed Increased Commitment]{.underline}") by notifying the Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to the Company) not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date five days before the Increase Date.

17

(v) \(1\) If the aggregate amount of Proposed New Commitments and Proposed Increased Commitments (such aggregate amount, the "[Total Committed Increase]{.underline}") equals or exceeds $25,000,000, then, subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2.05(c)(i):

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
(A) effective on and as of the Increase Date, the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall be increased by the Total Committed Increase (p [rovided]{.underline} that the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall in no event be increased pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) to more than $4,950,000,000) and shall be allocated among the New Lenders and the Lenders as provided in Section 2.05(c)(vi); and

(B) on the Increase Date, if any Advances are then outstanding, the Company shall borrow Advances from all or certain of the Lenders and/or (subject to compliance by the Company with Section 8.04(c)) prepay Advances of all or certain of the Lenders such that, after giving effect thereto, the Advances (including, without limitation, the Types and Interest Periods thereof) shall be held by the Lenders (including for such purposes New Lenders) ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments.

\(2\) If the Total Committed Increase is less than $25,000,000, then the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall not be changed pursuant to this Section 2.05(c).

(vi) The Total Committed Increase shall be allocated among New Lenders having Proposed New Commitments and Lenders having Proposed Increased Commitments, if any, as follows:

     1.  If the Total Committed Increase shall be at least $25,000,000 and less than or equal to the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, then (x) the initial Commitment of each New Lender shall be such New Lender's Proposed New Commitment and (y) the Commitment of each Lender shall be increased by such Lender's Proposed Increased Commitment, if any.

     2.  If the Total Committed Increase shall be greater than the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, then the Total Committed Increase shall be allocated:

         x.  [first]{.underline} to New Lenders (to the extent of their respective Proposed New Commitments) in such a manner as the Company shall agree; and

         y.  [then]{.underline} to Lenders on a pro rata basis based on the ratio of each Lender's Proposed Increased Commitment (if any) to the aggregate amount of the Proposed Increased Commitments of all of the Lenders.

(vii) No increase in the Commitments contemplated hereby shall become effective until the Agent shall have received (x) Notes payable to each New Lender and each other Lender whose Commitment is being increased to the extent such New Lender or Lender has requested such a Note pursuant to Section 2.13(e), and (y) evidence satisfactory to the Agent (including an update of the opinion of counsel provided pursuant to Section 3.01(f)(iv)) that such increases in the Commitments, and borrowings thereunder, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and other action on the part of the Company.

### Section 2.06 [Repayment of Advances; Extension of Termination Date]{.underline}.

(a) \(i\) Subject to the next succeeding sentence, each Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders on the Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of the Advances made to such Borrower then outstanding, and all accrued but unpaid interest in connection therewith and (ii) the Company shall pay to the Agent for the ratable account of the Lenders on the Termination Date all fees and all other amounts due hereunder. The Company may, upon notice to the Agent not later than the Termination Date, elect (the "[Term Loan Election]{.underline}") to convert all of the Advances outstanding on the Termination Date in effect at such time into a term loan which the Company shall repay in full ratably to the Lenders on the Maturity Date; p [rovided]{.underline} that the Term Loan Election may not be exercised unless the conditions set forth in Section

3.03 are satisfied on the date of notice of the Term Loan Election and on the Term Loan Conversion Date. All Advances converted into a term loan pursuant to this Section 2.06(a) shall continue to constitute Advances except that the Borrowers may not reborrow pursuant to Section 2.01 after all or any portion of such Advances have been prepaid pursuant to Section 2.10.

(b) The Company may, by written notice to the Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders) not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to each Termination Date (the Termination Date following such notice, the "[Extension Date]{.underline}"), request that the Termination Date then in effect (the "[Existing]{.underline} [Termination Date]{.underline}") be extended for a period of 364 days; p [rovided]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, that the Company shall not have made the Term Loan Election for Advances outstanding on such Termination Date prior to such time. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such request. If a Lender agrees, acting in its sole discretion, to so extend its Commitment (each such Lender, an "[Extending]{.underline} [Lender]{.underline}"), it will notify the Agent, in writing, of its decision to do so not more than 30 nor less than 20 days before the Extension Date; it being understood that failure to give such notice shall be deemed a decision not to extend. If any Lender fails to accept the Company's request for extension of the Termination Date (each such Lender, a "[Declining]{.underline} [Lender]{.underline}"), the Company shall have the right, prior to the Extension Date, to require any Declining Lender to assign in full its rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee (including any Extending Lender) designated by the Company that agrees to accept all of such rights and obligations and agrees to such extension (a "[Replacement Lender]{.underline}"), provided that (i) such assignment is otherwise in compliance with Section 8.07, (ii) such Declining Lender receives payment in full of the principal amount of all Advances owing to such Declining Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of such payment of principal and all other amounts payable to such Declining Lender under this Agreement and (iii) any such assignment shall be effective on the Extension Date. If (A) there are no Declining Lenders or all of the Declining Lenders are replaced by Replacement Lenders as set forth above and (B) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing immediately prior to the Extension Date, the Termination Date shall be extended by 364 days (except that, if the date on which the Termination Date is to be extended is not a Business Day, such Termination Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day), and the Agent shall promptly notify the Company of such extension. If there are any Declining Lenders that are not replaced in accordance with the terms above, the Company may (1) withdraw its request for an extension and the Existing Termination Date will remain in effect or (2) provided that no Default shall have occurred and be continuing immediately prior to the Extension Date, on the Extension Date pay any such Declining Lenders in full for all principal, interest and other amounts owing to such Declining Lender under this Agreement, reduce the aggregate Commitments of the Lenders by the amount of the Commitment of such Declining Lenders, and extend the Termination Date for 364 days at the reduced aggregate Commitment amount.

19

### Section 2.07 [Interest on Advances]{.underline}.

Each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance made to such Borrower owing to each Lender from the date of such Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

(a) [Base Rate Advances.]{.underline} During such periods as such Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the Base Rate in effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December during such periods and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

(b) [Term SOFR Advances]{.underline}. During such periods as such Advance is a Term SOFR Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such Advance to the sum of (x) Adjusted Term SOFR for such Interest Period for such Advance p [lus]{.underline} (y) 0.625%, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on each day that occurs during such Interest Period every three months from the first day of such Interest Period and on the date such Term SOFR Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

(c) [Eurocurrency Rate Advances]{.underline}.

(d) [Default Rate]{.underline}. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 6.01(a), the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the Advances and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (including without limitation fees and expenses) shall bear interest, payable on demand, at the Default Rate.

### Section 2.08 [Interest Rate Determination]{.underline}.

(a) The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Company and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Agent for purposes of Section 2.07.

\(i\) each Term SOFR Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance,

\(ii\) each Eurocurrency Rate Advance shall be exchanged into an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (iii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

20

(c) If the Company shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the Agent will forthwith so notify the Company and the Lenders and the Company will be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month.

(d) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances constituting any Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than the Borrowing Minimum, such Advances shall automatically (i) if such Advances are Term SOFR Advances, Convert into Base Rate Advances and (ii) if such Advances are Eurocurrency Rate Advances, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Converted into Base Rate Advances.

(f) If Term SOFR cannot be determined in accordance with the definition thereof, or if the EURIBO Rate does not appear Bloomberg, Thompson Reuters or on another nationally recognized service selected by the Agent,

    i.  the Agent shall forthwith notify the Company and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for the applicable Advances,

    ii. each such affected Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor (A) if such Advance is a Term SOFR Advance, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (B) if such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, be prepaid by the applicable Borrower or be automatically exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and be Converted into a Base Rate Advance (or if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate Advance), and

    iii. the obligation of the Lenders to make, or Convert Advances into, Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, as applicable, shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

Each such notice of a Conversion or continuation shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion or continuation, (ii) the Dollar denominated Advances to be Converted or continued, and (iii) if such Conversion is into Term SOFR Advances, the duration of the initial Interest Period for each such Advance.

If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation or administration of any law or regulation by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority that would be complied with generally by similarly situated banks acting reasonably (whether or not having the force of law and for the avoidance of doubt, including any changes resulting from requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity issued after the date hereof in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or promulgated after the date hereof by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 2.11(b) other than as set forth below) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then the Company shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Company and the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

b.  If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in or interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental or regulatory authority which becomes effective after the date hereof (for the avoidance of doubt, including any changes resulting from requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity issued after the date hereof in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or promulgated after the date hereof by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, there shall be any increase in the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital or liquidity is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender's Advances or commitment to lend and other commitments of this type by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Company shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital or liquidity to be allocable to the existence of such Lender's Advances or commitment to lend hereunder. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Company and the Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes as to the calculations therein, absent manifest error. Such certificate shall be in reasonable detail and shall certify that the claim for additional amounts referred to therein is generally consistent with such Lender's treatment of similarly situated customers of such Lender whose transactions with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information therein.

### Section 2.12 [Illegality]{.underline}.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Agent (and provide to the Company an opinion of counsel to the effect) that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances hereunder, (a) each Term SOFR Advance or each Eurocurrency Rate Advance, as applicable, made by such Lender will automatically, upon such demand, (i) if such Advance is a Term SOFR Advance, be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) if such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, be exchanged into an Equivalent amount of Dollars and be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (b) the obligation of the Lenders to make Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, as applicable, or to Convert Advances into Term SOFR Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

### Section 2.13 [Payments and Computations; Evidence of Advances]{.underline}.

(a) The Borrowers shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, except with respect to principal or, interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in Euros, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Agent at the applicable Agent's Account in same day funds without deduction, off-set or counterclaim except as provided in Section 2.14. The Borrowers shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in Euros, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in Euros to the Agent at the applicable Agent's Account in same day funds without deduction, off-set or counterclaim except as provided in Section 2.14. The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest, commitment fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c), 2.05(b), 2.06(b), 2.11, 2.14 or 8.04(c)) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Assumption and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(d), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Assumption, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Assumption shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

(b) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate (determined pursuant to clause (a) of the definition thereof) and of commitment fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on Adjusted Term SOFR, the EURIBO Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

24

(c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; p [rovided]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

(d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that a Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at (i) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (ii) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Euros.

(e) The Advances made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Advances made by the Lenders to a Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of a Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Advances. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Agent, each Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Agent) a Note which shall evidence such Lender\'s Advances in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note or Notes and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Advances and payments with respect thereto.

(f) To the extent that the Agent receives funds for application to the amounts owing by any Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement or any Note in currencies other than the currency or currencies required to enable the Agent to distribute funds to the Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.13, the Agent shall be entitled to convert or exchange such funds into Dollars or into Euros or from Dollars to Euros or from Euros to Dollars, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to enable the Agent to distribute such funds in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.13; p [rovided]{.underline} that each Borrower and each of the Lenders hereby agree that the Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any loss, cost or expense suffered by such Borrower or such Lender as a result of any conversion or exchange of currencies affected pursuant to this Section 2.13(f) or as a result of the failure of the Agent to effect any such conversion or exchange; and p [rovided further]{.underline} that such Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Lender, and hold the Agent and each Lender harmless, for any and all losses, costs and expenses incurred by the Agent or any Lender for any conversion or exchange of currencies (or the failure to convert or exchange any currencies) in accordance with this Section 2.13(f).

25

(g) In connection with the use or administration of any Benchmark, the Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement. The Agent will promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use or administration of any Benchmark.

### Section 2.14 [Taxes]{.underline}.

(a) Each Lender is exempt from any withholding tax imposed under the laws of the United States in respect of any fees, interest or other payments to which it is entitled pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes (the "[Income]{.underline}") because (i) the Lender is a United States Person; (ii) the Income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States within the meaning of Section 871 of the Internal Revenue Code; or (iii) the Income is eligible for an exemption by reason of a tax treaty. The Agent is exempt from any withholding tax imposed under the laws of the United States in respect of the Income because the Agent is a United States Person.

(b) Each Lender that is a United States Person shall, on or prior to the date it becomes a party hereto and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Company or the Agent, provide the Agent and the relevant Borrower with a properly completed and duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, or any successor or other form provided by the Internal Revenue Service. Each Lender that is not a United States Person (each, a "[Fore]{.underline}ig[n Lender]{.underline}") shall, on or prior to the date it becomes a party hereto and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Company or the Agent, provide the Agent and the relevant Borrower with a properly completed and duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI or W-8IMY (accompanied by Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-9 or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as appropriate), as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Foreign Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on any Income that is the subject of such forms. If the relevant Borrower determines, based on the form provided by a Foreign Lender (or the failure to provide such a form) at the time such Foreign Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement that a United States withholding tax rate in excess of zero applies to payments made by such Borrower to the Foreign Lender under this Agreement, such Borrower shall be permitted to deduct amounts from payments to such Foreign Lender to the extent required to pay withholding tax at such rate, and such amounts shall be considered excluded from Taxes as defined in Section 2.14(c); p [rovided, however]{.underline}, that, if on the date of the Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which a Foreign Lender becomes a Foreign Lender, pursuant to the Assignment and Assumption provisions of Article VIII, the Foreign Lender assignor was entitled to payments under Section 2.14(c) in respect of United States withholding tax paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to Taxes that are imposed pursuant to a Change in Law (defined below) after the date of Assignment and Assumption) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Foreign Lender assignee on such date. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of any Borrower under Section 2.14 of this Agreement shall not be increased as the result of any assignment pursuant to Article VIII of this Agreement with respect to United States withholding tax; p [rovided]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, that the foregoing shall not limit the obligation of any Borrower in respect of Taxes imposed as the result of any Change in Law after the date of the relevant Assignment and Assumption.

26

(c) Except as set forth in Section 2.14(b) or as required by applicable law, any and all payments by any Borrower hereunder or under the Notes shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any withholding taxes imposed on a Lender (such withholding taxes being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes", which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall exclude any Excluded Taxes). If any Borrower is required to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any Income, then: (i) the sum payable to such Lender shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions for such Taxes (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.14) such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes by the Company pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Company shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Borrower shall be entitled to pay any Taxes in any lawful manner so as to reduce any deductions and such Lender shall to the extent it is reasonably able provide any documentation or file any forms as may be required by the Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental agency. In addition, if any Lender or the Agent (in lieu of such Lender), as the case may be, is required to pay directly any Taxes because a Borrower cannot or does not legally or timely do so, the Company shall indemnify such Lender or Agent for payment of such Taxes, without duplication of, or increase in, the amount in respect of Taxes otherwise due to the Lender.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the sum payable to a Lender shall not be increased, and no indemnification payments shall be made, pursuant to Section 2.14(c) with respect to any United States federal withholding taxes any Borrower is required to deduct from or in respect of any Income, except to the extent that (i) such Borrower is required to deduct such taxes as a result of the enactment, promulgation, execution or ratification of, or any change in or amendment to, any United States law or any tax treaty (or in the application or official interpretation of any law or any tax treaty) that occurs after the date a Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement (a "[Change in Law]{.underline}") or (ii) such taxes are "Taxes" solely as a result of the application of the proviso to the penultimate sentence of Section 2.14(b).

(e) In addition, the Company agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (excluding any income or franchise taxes, business taxes or capital taxes of any nature) that arise from the execution or delivery, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as "[Other Taxes]{.underline}"). If a Lender is required to pay directly Other Taxes because a Borrower cannot or does not legally or timely do so, the Company shall indemnify such Lender for such payment of Other Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.14, each Lender shall upon the written request of and at the expense of the Company use reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such Other Taxes that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause imposition on such Lender of any material legal or regulatory burdens.

(f) To the extent any Lender is entitled to any exemption or reduction of foreign withholding taxes, each Lender shall cooperate with each Borrower by providing to the extent reasonably within its means any forms requested by such Borrower substantiating such reduction or exemption from such foreign withholding taxes required by any governmental agency.

(g) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to comply with the requirements of subsection (b) or (f) relating to certain forms intended to reduce withholding taxes (other than if such failure is due to a Change in Law that makes compliance with subsection (b) or (f) unduly burdensome in the reasonable judgment of such Lender), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 2.14.

27

(h) Upon a Change in Law or the imposition of any Taxes, a Lender shall, upon the written request of and at the expense of the Company, use reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such Taxes that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause the imposition on such Lender of any material legal or regulatory burdens.

(i) Any request by any Lender for payment of any amount under this Section 2.14 shall be accompanied by a certification that such Lender's claim for said amount is generally consistent with such Lender's treatment of similarly situated customers of such Lender whose transactions with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information therein.

(j) If any Lender shall become aware, including by means of a request by the Company, that it is entitled to receive a refund (including, for all purposes of this subsection (j), any refund in the form of a credit from the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes or Other Taxes) in respect of Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.14, or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14, it shall promptly notify such Borrower of the availability of such refund and shall, within 30 days after receipt of a request by the Company (whether as a result of notification that it has made to a Borrower or otherwise) to seek such refund, make a claim for such refund at such Borrower's expense. No Lender shall seek a refund without such approval by a Borrower. If a Lender receives a refund in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.14, or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14, it shall promptly notify such Borrower of such refund and shall within 30 days from the date of receipt of such refund pay over the amount of such refund to such Borrower to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 2.14 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund plus any interest paid or credited with respect to such refund, net of all out-of-pocket expenses and net of any loss or gain realized in the conversion of such funds from one to another currency incurred by the Agent of such Lender; p [rovided]{.underline} that the applicable Borrower, upon the request of the Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed with respect to such Taxes or Other Taxes by the relevant governmental agency) to the Agent or such Lender in the event the Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such governmental agency. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it reasonably deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.

(k) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3) (C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this subsection (k), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 2.14 shall be the only provisions requiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to bear the cost of (or arising from) any taxes otherwise borne by any Lender. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "taxes" includes any tax, governmental fee or other like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, withholding on amounts paid to or by the Company or its Subsidiaries), together with any interest, penalty, addition to tax or additional amount imposed with respect thereto.

28

### Section 2.15 [Sharing]{.underline} [of Payments, Etc]{.underline}.

If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Advances owing to it (other than pursuant to Section 2.05(b), 2.06(b), 2.11, 2.14, 8.04(c) or 8.07) in excess of its ratable share thereof, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; p [rovided]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

### Section 2.16 [Use of Proceeds]{.underline}.

The proceeds of the Advances shall be available (and the Company agrees that such proceeds shall be used) for general corporate purposes of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including but not limited to working capital, capital investments and acquisitions. No Borrower shall knowingly use the proceeds of any Advance to fund any activities or business (a) of or with any individual or entity that is included on the SDN List or (b) in, or with the government of, any Sanctioned Country, except in the case of (a) or (b) to the extent licensed by OFAC or otherwise permissible under U.S. law.

### Section 2.17 [Borrowings by Borrowing]{.underline} [Subsidiaries]{.underline}.

(a) The Company may, at any time or from time to time upon not less than 10 Business Days' notice in the case of any Subsidiary so designated after the Effective Date, designate one or more Subsidiaries as Borrowers hereunder by furnishing to the Agent a letter (a "[Des]{.underline}ig[nation]{.underline} [Letter]{.underline}") in duplicate, in substantially the form of Exhibit D, duly completed and executed by the Company and such Subsidiary. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Company's notice of such pending designation by the Company and the identity of the Subsidiary. Following the giving of any notice pursuant to this Section 2.17(a), if the designation of such Subsidiary obligates the Agent or any Lender to comply with "know your customer" or similar identification procedures (including without limitation the Beneficial Ownership Regulation) in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Company shall, promptly upon the request of the Agent or any Lender, supply such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Agent or any Lender in order for the Agent or such Lender to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with the results of all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations. Upon any such designation of a Subsidiary, such Subsidiary shall be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a Borrower entitled to borrow Advances on and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

29

If the Company shall designate as a Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder any Subsidiary not organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, any Lender may, with notice to the Agent and the Company, fulfill its Commitment by causing an Affiliate or a branch of such Lender to act as the Lender in respect of such Borrowing Subsidiary.

As soon as practicable after receiving notice from the Company or the Agent of the Company's intent to designate a Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary, and in any event no later than five Business Days after the delivery of such notice, if such Borrowing Subsidiary is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, any Lender that may not legally lend to, establish credit for the account of and/or do any business whatsoever with such Borrowing Subsidiary directly or through an Affiliate or a branch of such Lender as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph (a "[Protesting]{.underline} [Lender]{.underline}") shall so notify the Company and the Agent in writing. With respect to each Protesting Lender, the Company shall, effective on or before the date that such Borrowing Subsidiary shall have the right to borrow hereunder, either (A) notify the Agent and such Protesting Lender that the Commitments of such Protesting Lender shall be terminated; p [rovided]{.underline} that such Protesting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee Lender (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company or the relevant Borrowing Subsidiary (in the case of all other amounts), or (B) cancel its request to designate such Subsidiary as a "Borrowing Subsidiary" hereunder.

(b) If all principal of and interest on all Advances made to any Borrowing Subsidiary have been paid in full, the Company may terminate the status of such Borrowing Subsidiary as a Borrower hereunder by furnishing to the Agent a letter (a "[Termination Letter]{.underline}") in substantially the form of Exhibit E, duly completed and executed by the Company. Any Termination Letter furnished hereunder shall be effective upon receipt by the Agent, which shall promptly notify the Lenders, whereupon the Lenders shall, upon payment in full of all amounts owing by such Borrower hereunder, promptly deliver to the Company (through the Agent) the Notes, if any, of such former Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of a Termination Letter with respect to any Borrower shall not terminate (i) any obligation of such Borrower that remains unpaid at the time of such delivery (including without limitation any obligation arising thereafter in respect of such Borrower under Section 2.11 or 2.14) or (ii) the obligations of the Company under Article IX with respect to any such unpaid obligations; provided that if the status of such Borrowing Subsidiary has been terminated as aforesaid because the Company has sold or transferred its interest in such Subsidiary, and the Company so certifies to the Agent at the time of the delivery of such Termination Letter, and subject to payment of said principal and interest, (A) such Subsidiary shall automatically, upon the effectiveness of the delivery of such Termination Letter and certification, cease to have any obligation under this Agreement or the Notes and (B) the Company shall automatically be deemed to have unconditionally assumed, as primary obligor, and hereby agrees to pay and perform, all of such obligations.

30

### Section 2.18 [Benchmark Replacement Setting]{.underline}.

(a) [Benchmark Replacement]{.underline}. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to any setting of any Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (a) of the definition of "Benchmark Replacement" for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and the definition of "Adjusted Term SOFR" shall be deemed modified to delete clause (b) for any calculation of Term SOFR and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (b) of the definition of "Benchmark Replacement" for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00

p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis.

(b) [Benchmark Replacement Conforming]{.underline} [Changes]{.underline}. In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.

(c) [Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations]{.underline}. The Agent will promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of (i) any Benchmark Replacement Date and the related Benchmark Replacement, (ii) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes, (iii) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (d) below and (iv) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. For the avoidance of doubt, any notice required to be delivered by the Agent as set forth in this Section 2.18 may be provided, at the option of the Agent (in its sole discretion), in one or more notices and may be delivered together with, or as part of any amendment which implements any Benchmark Replacement or Conforming Changes. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.18, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.18.

(d) [Unavailabili]{.underline}ty [of Tenor of Benchmark]{.underline}. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate or the EURIBO Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Agent may modify the definition of "Interest Period" for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Agent may modify the definition of "Interest Period" for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.

Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

## ARTICLE VII THE AGENT

### Section 7.01 [A]{.underline}p pointment and Authority.

Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Citibank, N.A. to act on its behalf as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Except as expressly provided herein, the provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrowers shall not have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term "agent" herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. The Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

### Section 7.02 [R]{.underline}ig[hts as a Lender]{.underline}.

The Person serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

44

### Section 7.03 [Exculpatory Provisions]{.underline}.

(a) The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent:

    i.  shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;

    ii. shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); p [rovided]{.underline} that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any debtor relief law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any debtor relief law; and

    iii. shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

(b) The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 8.01 and 6.01), or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Agent in writing by the Company or a Lender.

(c) The Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Agent.

### Section 7.04 [Reliance by Agent]{.underline}.

The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of an Advance that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Advance. The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

45

### Section 7.05 [Indemnification]{.underline}.

The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company), ratably according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Advances then made by each of them (or if no Advances are at the time outstanding, ratably according to the respective amounts of their Commitments), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under this Agreement; p [rovided]{.underline} that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agent's gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement in bad faith. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Company.

### Section 7.06 [Delegation of Duties]{.underline}.

The Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent and approved by the Company. The Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub- agent and to the Related Parties of the Agent and any such sub-agent. The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub- agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non appealable judgment that the Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents.

### Section 7.07 [Res]{.underline}ig[nation of Agent]{.underline}.

(a) The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Company. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor approved by the Company, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the "[Res]{.underline}ig[nation Effective Date]{.underline}"), then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.

(b) If the Person serving as Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (e) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Company and such Person remove such Person as Agent and appoint a successor approved by the Company. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the "[Removal Effective Date]{.underline}"), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.

46

(c) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent, and the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the retiring or removed Agent's resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article (and, as to the Agent, Section 8.04) shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Agent was acting as Agent.

### Section 7.08 [Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders]{.underline}.

Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

### Section 7.09 [Syndication Agent and Lead Arrangers]{.underline}.

Without prejudice to the obligations of the Agent hereunder, the Syndication Agent and Lead Arrangers, in their capacities as such, have no duties, obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement.

### Section 7.10 [Certain ERISA Matters]{.underline}.

A notice of the Agent to any Payment Recipient under this clause (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

(b) Without limiting the immediately preceding clause (a), each Lender, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender, hereby further agrees that if it receives a payment, prepayment or repayment (whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise) from the Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Agent (or any of its Affiliates), or (z) that such Lender, or such other recipient, otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) in each case:

    i.  \(A\) in the case of immediately preceding clauses (x) or (y), an error shall be presumed to have been made (absent written confirmation from the Agent to the contrary) or (B) an error has been made (in the case of immediately preceding clause (z)), in each case, with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment; and

    ii. such Lender shall (and shall cause any other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to) promptly (and, in all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of such error) notify the Agent of its receipt of such payment, prepayment or repayment, the details thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Agent pursuant to this Section 7.11(b).

(c) Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Agent to such Lender from any source, against any amount due to the Agent under immediately preceding clause (a) or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement.

49

(d) In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by the Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (a), from any Lender that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and/or from any Payment Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) on its respective behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an "[Erroneous]{.underline} [Payment Return Deficiency]{.underline}"), upon the Agent's notice to such Lender at any time, (i) such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned its Advances (but not its Commitments) in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Agent may specify) (such assignment of such Advances (but not Commitments), the "[Erroneous Payment Deficiency Ass]{.underline}ig[nment]{.underline}") at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment fee to be waived by the Agent in such instance), and is hereby (together with the Company) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an approved electronic platform as to which the Agent and such parties are participants) to the Agent, as the assignee Lender, with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and such Lender shall deliver any Notes evidencing such Advances to the Borrowers or the Agent, (ii) the Agent as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to acquire the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (iii) upon such deemed acquisition, the Agent as the assignee Lender shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the assigning Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender and (iv) the Agent may reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the Advances subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment. The Agent may sell any Advances acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment in accordance with Section 8.07 hereof (pursuant to which the prior written consent of the Company is required for any such sale (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)), and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Advance (or portion thereof), and the Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender (and/or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf). For the avoidance of doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender and such Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, each party hereto agrees that, except to the extent that the Agent has sold an Advance (or portion thereof) acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and irrespective of whether the Agent may be equitably subrogated, the Agent shall be contractually subrogated to all the rights and interests of the applicable Lender under the Loan Documents with respect to each Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (the "[Erroneous Payment Subrogation R]{.underline}ig[hts]{.underline}").

(e) The parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any obligations owed by any Borrower, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, or any portion of such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Agent from any Borrower for the purpose of making a payment, prepayment, repayment, discharge or satisfaction in respect of the obligations under any Loan Document. For the avoidance of doubt, clause (d) above and this clause (e) shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for), or have the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the obligations of any Borrower relative to the amount (and/or timing for payment) of the obligations of any Borrower that would have been payable had the Erroneous Payment not been made by the Agent.

(f) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on "discharge for value" or any similar doctrine

(g) Each party's obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 7.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations of any Borrower (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.

$10,000,000, (iii) each such assignment shall be to an Eligible Assignee, (iv) each such assignment made as a result of a demand by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.07(a) shall be arranged by the Company after consultation with the Agent and shall be either an assignment of all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement or an assignment of a portion of such rights and obligations made concurrently with another such assignment or other such assignments that together cover all of the rights and obligations of the assigning Lender under this Agreement, (v) no Lender shall be obligated to make any such assignment as a result of a demand by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.07(a) unless and until such Lender shall have received one or more payments from either the Company or one or more Eligible Assignees in an aggregate amount at least equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing to such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all other amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement,

\(vi\) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the Register (as defined in clause (d) below), an Assignment and Assumption, together with any Note requested pursuant to Section 2.13(e) subject to such assignment and a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and (vii) the Eligible Assignee shall complete, execute and deliver to the Borrowers and Agent the appropriate tax form pursuant to Section 2.14.

54

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "[Granting]{.underline} [Lender]{.underline}") may grant to a special purpose vehicle (an "[SPV]{.underline}") of such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Agent and the Company, the option to provide to the Borrowers all or any part of any Advance that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.01, p [rovided]{.underline} that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any Advance, (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Advance, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Advance pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) the Borrowers may bring any proceeding against either the Granting Lender or the SPV in order to enforce any rights of the Borrowers hereunder. The making of an Advance by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Advance were made by the Granting Lender. Each party hereto hereby agrees that no SPV shall be liable for any payment under this Agreement for which a Lender would otherwise be liable, for so long as, and to the extent, the related Granting Lender makes such payment. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness of any SPV, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, such SPV any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or similar proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State thereof arising out of any claim against such SPV under this Agreement. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section, any SPV may with notice to, but without the prior written consent of, the Company or the Agent and without paying any processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Advances to its Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the Company and the Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support (if any) with respect to commercial paper issued by such SPV to fund such Advances and such SPV may disclose, on a confidential basis, confidential information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider of a surety, guarantee or credit liquidity enhancement to such SPV. This paragraph may not be amended without the consent of any SPV at the time holding Advances under this Agreement.

The relevant Borrower, at its own expense, shall if so requested pursuant to Section 2.13(e) execute and deliver to the Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note a new Note to the order of such Eligible Assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption and, if the assigning Lender has retained a Commitment hereunder, a new Note to the order of the assigning Lender in an amount equal to the Commitment retained by it hereunder.

(c) The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any sum due from it in any currency (the "[Primary Currency]{.underline}") to any Lender or the Agent hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in any other currency (the "[Judgment Currency]{.underline}"), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be), of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the applicable Primary Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased is less than such sum originally due to such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, such Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) against such loss, and if the amount of the applicable Primary Currency so purchased exceeds such sum due to any Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) in the applicable Primary Currency, such Lender or the Agent (as the case may be) agrees to remit such excess to such Borrower.

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, PEPSICO, INC., a North Carolina corporation (the "[Borrower]{.underline}"), HEREBY PROMISES TO PAY to the order of (the "[Lender]{.underline}") for the account of its Applicable Lending Office on the later of the Termination Date and the Maturity Date (each as defined in the Credit Agreement referred to below) the principal amount of the Advances made by the Lender to the Borrower pursuant to the 364-Day Credit Agreement dated as of May 26, 2023 among the Borrower, the Lender and certain other lenders parties thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as Agent for the Lender and such other lenders (as amended or modified from time to time, the "[Credit Agreement]{.underline}"; the terms defined therein being used herein as therein defined) outstanding on the later of the Termination Date and the Maturity Date.

The Borrower promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Advance from the date of such Advance until such principal amount is paid in full, at such interest rates, and payable at such times, as are specified in the Credit Agreement.

Both principal and interest in respect of each Advance (i) denominated in Dollars are payable in lawful money of the United States of America and

\(ii\) denominated in Euros are payable in such currency, in each case to Citibank, N.A., as Agent, at the Agent's Account, in same day funds for the account of the Lender. Each Advance owing to the Lender by the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and all payments made on account of principal thereof, shall be recorded by the Lender and, prior to any transfer hereof, endorsed on the grid attached hereto which is part of this Promissory Note. Each such endorsement shall constitute p [rima facie]{.underline} evidence of the accuracy of the information so endorsed.

This Promissory Note is one of the Notes referred to in, and is entitled to the benefits of, the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement, among other things, (i) provides for the making of Advances by the Lender to the Borrower from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the U.S. dollar amount first above mentioned, the indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from each such Advance being evidenced by this Promissory Note, (ii) contains provisions for determining the Equivalent in Dollars for Advances denominated in Euros and (iii) contains provisions for acceleration of the maturity hereof upon the happening of certain stated events and also for prepayments on account of principal hereof prior to the maturity hereof upon the terms and conditions therein specified.

The Borrower hereby waives presentment, demand, protest and notice of any kind. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any rights hereunder on the part of the holder hereof shall operate as a waiver of such rights.

This Promissory Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

In the case of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that the related Notice of Borrowing specifies is to be comprised of Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the Company shall indemnify each Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender as a result of any failure by the applicable Borrower to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing for such Revolving Credit Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such Lender as part of such Revolving Credit Borrowing when such Revolving Credit Advance, as a result of such failure, is not made on such date.

(d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the time of any Revolving Credit Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender's ratable portion of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such portion available to the Agent on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.02 and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the relevant Borrower on such date a corresponding amount.

(e) The failure of any Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by it as part of any Revolving Credit Borrowing shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Revolving Credit Advance on the date of such Revolving Credit Borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make the Revolving Credit Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Revolving Credit Borrowing.

(b) If any Lender (i) shall make a demand under Section 2.11 or 2.14 or (ii) is a Defaulting Lender or Non-Consenting Lender, the Company shall have the right, upon at least three Business Days' notice, to terminate in full the Commitment(s) of such Lender or to demand that such Lender assign to one or more Persons all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement in accordance with Section 8.07. If the Company shall elect to terminate in full the Commitment(s) of any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.05(b), the Company shall pay to such Lender, on the effective date of such Lender's Commitment termination, an amount equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Advances owing to such Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of payment of such principal amount and all other amounts payable to such Lender under this Agreement, whereupon such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto.

(c) \(i\) From time to time, the Company may propose to increase the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments by an aggregate amount of $25,000,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof (a "[Proposed A]{.underline}gg[regate Commitment Increase]{.underline}") in the manner set forth below, provided that:

    1.  no Default shall have occurred and be continuing either as of the applicable Increase Notice Date (as hereinafter defined) or as of the related Increase Date (as hereinafter defined); and

    2.  after giving effect to any such increase, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall not exceed $4,950,000,000.

18

(ii) From time to time the Company may request an increase in the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments by delivering to the Agent a notice (an "[Increase Notice]{.underline}"; the date of delivery thereof to the Agent being the "[Increase]{.underline} [Notice Date]{.underline}") specifying (1) the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, (2) the proposed date (the "[Increase Date]{.underline}") on which the Revolving Credit Commitments would be so increased (which Increase Date may not be fewer than 30 days after the Increase Notice Date) and (3) the New Lenders, if any, to whom the Company desires to offer the opportunity to commit to all or a portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase. The Agent shall in turn promptly notify each Lender of the Company's request by sending each Lender a copy of such notice.

(iii) Not later than the date five days after the Increase Notice Date, the Agent shall notify each New Lender, if any, identified in the related Increase Notice of the opportunity to commit to all or any portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase. Each such New Lender may irrevocably commit to all or a portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase (such New Lender's "[Proposed New Commitment]{.underline}") by notifying the Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to the Company) before 11:00

A.M. (New York City time) on the date that is 10 days after the Increase Notice Date; p [rovided]{.underline} that:

(1) the Proposed New Commitment of each New Lender shall be in an amount not less than $25,000,000; and

(2) each New Lender that submits a Proposed New Commitment shall enter into an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Company and the Agent pursuant to which such New Lender shall undertake a Revolving Credit Commitment (and, if any such New Lender is already a Lender, its Revolving Credit Commitment shall be in addition to such Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment hereunder on such date), and shall pay to the Agent a processing and recordation fee of

$3,500.

(iv) If, and only if, the aggregate Proposed New Commitments of all of the New Lenders shall be less than the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, then (unless the Company otherwise requests) the Agent shall, on or prior to the date that is 15 days after the Increase Notice Date, notify each Lender of the opportunity to so commit to all or any portion of the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase not committed to by New Lenders pursuant to Section 2.05(c)(iii). Each Lender may, if, in its sole discretion, it elects to do so, irrevocably offer to commit to all or a portion of such remainder (such Lender's "[Proposed Increased Commitment]{.underline}") by notifying the Agent (which shall give prompt notice thereof to the Company) not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the date five days before the Increase Date.

(v) \(1\) If the aggregate amount of Proposed New Commitments and Proposed Increased Commitments (such aggregate amount, the "[Total Committed Increase]{.underline}") equals or exceeds $25,000,000, then, subject to the conditions set forth in Section 2.05(c)(i):

    A.  effective on and as of the Increase Date, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall be increased by the Total Committed Increase (p [rovided]{.underline} that the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall in no event be increased pursuant to this Section 2.05(c) to more than

$4,950,000,000) and shall be allocated among the New Lenders and the Lenders as provided in Section 2.05(c)(vi); and

19

B.  on the Increase Date, if any Revolving Credit Advances are then outstanding, the Company shall borrow Revolving Credit Advances from all or certain of the Lenders and/or (subject to compliance by the Company with Section 8.04(c)) prepay Revolving Credit Advances of all or certain of the Lenders such that, after giving effect thereto, the Revolving Credit Advances (including, without limitation, the Types and Interest Periods thereof) shall be held by the Lenders (including for such purposes New Lenders) ratably in accordance with their respective Revolving Credit Commitments. If any Swing Line Advances are outstanding on any Increase Date, participations in such Swing Line Advances shall be deemed to be reallocated on such date according to the respective Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders after giving effect to such Total Committed Increase.

\(2\) If the Total Committed Increase is less than $25,000,000, then the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments shall not be changed pursuant to this Section 2.05(c).

(vi) The Total Committed Increase shall be allocated among New Lenders having Proposed New Commitments and Lenders having Proposed Increased Commitments, if any, as follows:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
(1) If the Total Committed Increase shall be at least $25,000,000 and less than or equal to the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, then (x) the initial Commitment of each New Lender shall be such New Lender's Proposed New Commitment and (y) the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Lender shall be increased by such Lender's Proposed Increased Commitment, if any.

(2) If the Total Committed Increase shall be greater than the Proposed Aggregate Commitment Increase, then the Total Committed Increase shall be allocated:

    x.  [first]{.underline} to New Lenders (to the extent of their respective Proposed New Commitments) in such a manner as the Company shall agree; and

    y.  [then]{.underline} to Lenders on a pro rata basis based on the ratio of each Lender's Proposed Increased Commitment (if any) to the aggregate amount of the Proposed Increased Commitments of all of the Lenders.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
(vii) No increase in the Revolving Credit Commitments contemplated hereby shall become effective until the Agent shall have received (x) Revolving Credit Notes payable to each New Lender and each other Lender whose Revolving Credit Commitment is being increased to the extent such New Lender or Lender has requested such a Revolving Credit Note pursuant to Section 2.13(e), and

\(y\) evidence satisfactory to the Agent (including an update of the opinion of counsel provided pursuant to Section 3.01(f)(iv)) that such increases in the Revolving Credit Commitments, and borrowings thereunder, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate and other action on the part of the Company.

### Section 2.06 [Repayment of Advances; Extension of Termination Date]{.underline}.

(a) \(i\) Each Borrower shall repay to the Agent for the ratable account of each Lender on the Termination Date applicable to such Lender the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances made to such Borrower by such Lender then outstanding, and all accrued but unpaid interest in connection therewith and all fees and all other amounts due hereunder. (ii) Each Borrower shall repay to the Agent, for the ratable account of each Swing Line Lender and each Lender that has funded its participation in a Swing Line Advance, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Swing Line Advance made to such Borrower and owing to such Lender on the earlier of (i) the Termination Date applicable to such Lender and (ii) seven days after such Swing Line Advance is made.

(b) The Company may, by written notice to the Agent (which shall promptly notify the Lenders) not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to each anniversary of the date hereof (such anniversary date following such notice under this Section 2.06(b), the "[Extension Date]{.underline}"), request that the Termination Date then in effect (the "[Existing]{.underline} [Termination Date]{.underline}") be extended for a period of one year; p [rovided]{.underline} that the Company shall not exercise such option more than twice. If a Lender agrees, acting in its sole discretion, to so extend its Commitment(s) under this Section 2.06(b) (each such Lender, an "[Extending]{.underline} [Lender]{.underline}"), it will notify the Agent, in writing, of its decision to do so not more than 30 nor less than 20 days before the Extension Date; it being understood that failure to give such notice shall be deemed a decision not to extend. If any Lender fails to accept the Company's request for extension of the Termination Date under this Section 2.06(b) (each such Lender, a "[Declining]{.underline} [Lender]{.underline}"), the Company shall have the right to require any Declining Lender to assign in full its rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Eligible Assignee (including any Extending Lender) designated by the Company that agrees to accept all of such rights and obligations and agrees to such extension (a "[Replacement Lender]{.underline}"), p [rovided]{.underline} that (i) such assignment is otherwise in compliance with Section 8.07, (ii) such Declining Lender receives payment in full of the principal amount of all Advances owing to such Declining Lender, together with accrued interest thereon to the date of such payment of principal and all other amounts payable to such Declining Lender under this Agreement and (iii) any such assignment shall be effective on the Extension Date. If no Default shall have occurred and be continuing immediately prior to the Extension Date, (i) the Termination Date for such Extending Lenders and Replacement Lenders shall be extended by one year, and the Agent shall promptly notify the Company of such extension (except that, if the date on which the Termination Date is to be extended is not a Business Day, such Termination Date as so extended shall be the next preceding Business Day), (ii) the Termination Date for any Declining Lenders not replaced shall be the Existing Termination Date and (iii) all Advances and other amounts payable hereunder to such Declining Lenders shall become due and payable on the Existing Termination Date, the total Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders hereunder shall be reduced by the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Declining Lenders so terminated on the Existing Termination Date and, if any Declining Lender is a Swing Line Lender, the total Swing Line Commitments of the Swing Line Lenders hereunder shall be reduced by the Swing Line Commitment of such Declining Lenders so terminated on the Existing Termination Date.

### Section 2.07 [Interest on Advances]{.underline}.

(a) [Revolving]{.underline} [Credit Advances]{.underline}. Each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Credit Advance made to such Borrower owing to each Lender from the date of such Revolving Credit Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

21

i.  [Base Rate Advances.]{.underline} During such periods as such Revolving Credit Advance is a Base Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times to the Base Rate in effect from time to time, payable in arrears quarterly on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December during such periods and on the date such Base Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

ii. [Term SOFR Advances]{.underline}. During such periods as such Revolving Credit Advance is a Term SOFR Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such Revolving Credit Advance to the sum of (x) Adjusted Term SOFR for such Interest Period for such Revolving Credit Advance p [lus]{.underline} (y) 0.625%, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on each day that occurs during such Interest Period every three months from the first day of such Interest Period and on the date such Term SOFR Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

iii. [Eurocurrency Rate Advances]{.underline}. During such periods as such Revolving Credit Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, a rate per annum equal at all times during each Interest Period for such Revolving Credit Advance to the sum of (x) the EURIBO Rate for such Interest Period for such Revolving Credit Advance p [lus]{.underline} (y) 0.625%, payable in arrears on the last day of such Interest Period and, if such Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on each day that occurs during such Interest Period every three months from the first day of such Interest Period and on the date such Eurocurrency Rate Advance shall be Converted or paid in full.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
(b) [Swing]{.underline} [Line Advances]{.underline}. Each Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Swing Line Advance made to such Borrower from the date of such Swing Line Advance until such principal amount shall be paid in full at a rate per annum equal at all times to the sum of

\(x\) the Overnight Rate in effect from time to time p [lus]{.underline} (y) 0.625%, payable in arrears on the date such Swing Line Advance shall be, or shall be required to be, paid in full. For the period from the date of such Swing Line Borrowing and ending on the date the Lenders fund their participations in such Swing Line Advance in accordance with Section 2.20(d), such interest shall be for the sole account of the Swing Line Lenders.

(c) [Default Rate]{.underline}. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default pursuant to Section 6.01(a), the principal of and, to the extent permitted by law, interest on the Advances and any other amounts owing hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (including without limitation fees and expenses) shall bear interest, payable on demand, at the Default Rate.

### Section 2.08 [Interest Rate Determination]{.underline}.

(a) The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Company and the Lenders of the applicable interest rate determined by the Agent for purposes of Section 2.07.

(b) If, due to a major disruption in the interbank funding market with respect to any Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, the Required Lenders notify the Agent that the Adjusted Term SOFR or the EURIBO Rate, as applicable, for any Interest Period for such Advances will not adequately reflect the cost to such Required Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their respective Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances for such Interest Period, the Agent shall forthwith so notify the Borrowers and the Lenders, whereupon

    i.  each Term SOFR Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor, Convert into a Base Rate Advance,

    ii. each Eurocurrency Rate Advance shall be exchanged into an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Converted into a Base Rate Advance and

    iii. the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Revolving Credit Advances into, Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

22

(c) If the Company shall fail to select the duration of any Interest Period for any Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances in accordance with the provisions contained in the definition of "Interest Period" in Section 1.01, the Agent will forthwith so notify the Company and the Lenders and the Company will be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month.

(d) On the date on which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances constituting any Borrowing shall be reduced, by payment or prepayment or otherwise, to less than the Borrowing Minimum, such Advances shall automatically (i) if such Advances are Term SOFR Advances, Convert into Base Rate Advances and (ii) if such Advances are Eurocurrency Rate Advances, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Converted into Base Rate Advances.

(e) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing, (i) each Term SOFR Advance and each Eurocurrency Rate Advance shall automatically (A) if such Advance is a Term SOFR Advance, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (B) if such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, be exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) the obligation of the Lenders to make, or to Convert Advances into, Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances shall be suspended.

(f) If (x) Term SOFR cannot be determined in accordance with the definition thereof, (y) the EURIBO Rate does not appear Bloomberg, Thompson Reuters or on another nationally recognized service selected by the Agent or the Sub-Agent, or (z) the Overnight Rate cannot be determined in accordance with the definition thereof,

    i.  the Agent shall forthwith notify the Company and the Lenders that the interest rate cannot be determined for the applicable Advances,

    ii. each such affected Advance will automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period therefor (A) if such Advance is a Term SOFR Advance, Convert into a Base Rate Advance and (B) if such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, be prepaid by the applicable Borrower or be automatically exchanged for an Equivalent amount of Dollars and be Converted into a Base Rate Advance (or if such Advance is then a Base Rate Advance, will continue as a Base Rate Advance), and

    iii. the obligation of the Lenders to make, or Convert Revolving Credit Advances into, Term SOFR Advances, Eurocurrency Rate Advances or Swing Line Advances, as applicable, shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

23

### Section 2.09 [Optional Conversion or Continuation of Revolving]{.underline} [Credit Advances]{.underline}.

The Company may on any Business Day, upon notice given to the Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third U.S. Government Securities Business Day prior to the date of the proposed Conversion or continuation, and subject to the provisions of Sections 2.08, 2.12 and 2.18, Convert all or any part of the Revolving Credit Advances denominated in Dollars of one Type constituting the same Borrowing into Revolving Credit Advances denominated in Dollars of another Type or continue all or any part of the Advance of one Type constituting the same Borrowing or Advances of the same Type and in the same currency; p [rovided]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, that any Conversion of Term SOFR Advances into Base Rate Advances shall be made only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Term SOFR Advances, any Conversion of Base Rate Advances into Term SOFR Advances shall be in an amount not less than the Borrowing Minimum and no Conversion of any Revolving Credit Advances shall result in more separate Revolving Credit Borrowings than permitted under Section 2.02(b). Each such notice of a Conversion or continuation shall, within the restrictions specified above, specify (i) the date of such Conversion or continuation, (ii) the Dollar denominated Revolving Credit Advances to be Converted or continued, and (iii) if such Conversion is into Term SOFR Advances, the duration of the initial Interest Period for each such Advance. Each notice of Conversion or continuation shall be irrevocable and binding on the Company.

### Section 2.10 [Prepayments of Revolving]{.underline} [Credit Advances]{.underline}.

(a) [Optional]{.underline}. The Company may, upon at least three U.S. Government Securities Business Days' notice, in the case of Term SOFR Advances, three Business Days' notice, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Advances, to the Agent and one Business Day's notice in the case of any Revolving Credit Borrowing comprised of Base Rate Advances to (i) the Agent or (ii) the Sub-Agent in the case of any Swing Line Advances, in each case stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Company shall, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances constituting part of the same Revolving Credit Borrowing or such Swing Line Advances comprising the same Swing Line Borrowing in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; p [rovided]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, that (x) each partial prepayment shall be in an aggregate principal amount of the Borrowing Minimum or a Borrowing Multiple in excess thereof in the case of Revolving Credit Advances and in an aggregate principal amount of

€10,000,000 in the case of Swing Line Advances and (y) in the event of any such prepayment of a Term SOFR Advance or a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, the Company shall be obligated to reimburse the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 8.04(c).

(b) [Mandatory]{.underline}. (i) If, on any date, the Agent notifies the Company in accordance with clause (iii) below that, as of the most recent interest payment date, the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Dollars then outstanding plus (B) the Equivalent in Dollars (determined on the third Business Day prior to such interest payment date) of the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Euros then outstanding exceeds 105% of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments on such date, the Borrowers shall, as soon as practicable and in any event within five Business Days after receipt of such notice, prepay the outstanding principal amount of any Advances in an aggregate amount sufficient to reduce such sum to an amount not to exceed 100% of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments on such date (subject to the proviso to this sentence set forth below), together with any interest accrued to the date of such prepayment on the aggregate principal amount of Advances prepaid; p [rovided]{.underline} that if the aggregate principal amount of Base Rate Advances outstanding at the time of such required prepayment is less than the amount of such required prepayment, the portion of such required prepayment in excess of the aggregate principal amount of Base Rate Advances then outstanding shall be deferred until the last day of the next maturing Interest Period of the outstanding Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, in an aggregate amount equal to the excess of such required prepayment. The Agent shall give prompt notice of any prepayment required under this Section 2.10(b) to the Company in accordance with clause (iii) below and the Lenders.

24

(ii) Each prepayment made pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) shall be made together with any interest accrued to the date of such prepayment on the principal amounts prepaid and, in the case of any prepayment of a Term SOFR Advance or a Eurocurrency Rate Advance on a date other than the last day of an Interest Period, any additional amounts which the applicable Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse to the Lenders in respect thereof pursuant to Section 8.04(c).

(iii) The Agent shall calculate on the date of each Notice of Borrowing and on each interest payment date the sum of (A) the aggregate principal amount of all Advances denominated in Dollars plus (B) the Equivalent in Dollars (determined on the third Business Day prior to the date such calculation is required under this clause (iii)) of the aggregate principal amount of all Eurocurrency Rate Advances and shall give prompt notice (and in any event no later than thirty days) of any prepayment required in connection with an interest payment date under this Section 2.10(b) to the Company and the Lenders.

### Section 2.11 [Increased Costs]{.underline}.

a.  If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in any law or regulation or in the interpretation or administration of any law or regulation by any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental authority that would be complied with generally by similarly situated banks acting reasonably (whether or not having the force of law and for the avoidance of doubt, including any changes resulting from requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity issued after the date hereof in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or promulgated after the date hereof by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III), there shall be any increase in the cost to any Lender of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 2.11(b) other than as set forth below) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then the Company shall from time to time, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender for such increased cost. A certificate as to the amount of such increased cost, submitted to the Company and the Agent by such Lender, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

b.  If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change in or interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) compliance with any guideline or request from any central bank or other governmental or regulatory authority which becomes effective after the date hereof (for the avoidance of doubt, including any changes resulting from requests, rules, guidelines or directives concerning capital adequacy or liquidity issued after the date hereof in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or promulgated after the date hereof by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, there shall be any increase in the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by any Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender and that the amount of such capital or liquidity is increased by or based upon the existence of such Lender's Advances or commitment to lend and other commitments of this type by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then, upon demand by such Lender (with a copy of such demand to the Agent), the Company shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Lender, from time to time as specified by such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate such Lender or such corporation in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital or liquidity to be allocable to the existence of such Lender's Advances or commitment to lend hereunder. A certificate as to such amounts submitted to the Company and the Agent by such Lender shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes as to the calculations therein, absent manifest error. Such certificate shall be in reasonable detail and shall certify that the claim for additional amounts referred to therein is generally consistent with such Lender's treatment of similarly situated customers of such Lender whose transactions with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information therein.

25

### Section 2.12 [Illegality]{.underline}.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any Lender shall notify the Agent (and provide to the Company an opinion of counsel to the effect) that the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation makes it unlawful, or any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its Eurocurrency Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder to make Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances or to fund or maintain Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances hereunder, (a) each Term SOFR Advance or each Eurocurrency Rate Advance, as applicable, made by such Lender will automatically, upon such demand, (i) if such Advance is a Term SOFR Advance, be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (ii) if such Advance is a Eurocurrency Rate Advance, be exchanged into an Equivalent amount of Dollars and be Converted into a Base Rate Advance and (b) the obligation of the Lenders to make Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances, as applicable, or to Convert Advances into Term SOFR Advances shall be suspended until the Agent shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

### Section 2.13 [Payments and Computations; Evidence of Advances]{.underline}.

(a) The Borrowers shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes, except with respect to principal or, interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in Euros, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in Dollars to the Agent at the applicable Agent's Account in same day funds without deduction, off-set or counterclaim except as provided in Section 2.14. The Borrowers shall make each payment hereunder and under the Notes with respect to principal of, interest on, and other amounts relating to, Advances denominated in Euros, not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the day when due in Euros to the Agent at the applicable Agent's Account in same day funds without deduction, off-set or counterclaim except as provided in Section 2.14. The Agent will promptly thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest, commitment fees ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.02(c), 2.05(b), 2.06(b), 2.11, 2.14 or 8.04(c)) to the Lenders for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to such Lender for the account of its Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon its acceptance of an Assignment and Assumption and recording of the information contained therein in the Register pursuant to Section 8.07(d), from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and Assumption, the Agent shall make all payments hereunder and under the Notes in respect of the interest assigned thereby to the Lender assignee thereunder, and the parties to such Assignment and Assumption shall make all appropriate adjustments in such payments for periods prior to such effective date directly between themselves.

26

(b) All computations of interest based on the Base Rate (determined pursuant to clause (a) of the definition thereof) and of commitment fees shall be made by the Agent on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on Adjusted Term SOFR, the EURIBO Rate, the Overnight Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Agent or the Sub-Agent, as the case may be, on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest or fees are payable. Each determination by the Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

(c) Whenever any payment hereunder or under the Notes shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be; p [rovided]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, that, if such extension would cause payment of interest on or principal of Term SOFR Advances or Eurocurrency Rate Advances to be made in the next following calendar month, such payment shall be made on the next preceding Business Day.

(d) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that a Borrower will not make such payment in full, the Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender. If and to the extent such Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the Agent, each Lender shall repay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to the Agent, at (i) the Federal Funds Rate in the case of Advances denominated in Dollars or (ii) the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount in the case of Advances denominated in Euros.

(e) The Advances made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Advances made by the Lenders to a Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of a Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Advances. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the Agent, each Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Agent) a Revolving Credit Note which shall evidence such Lender\'s Advances in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note or Notes and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its Advances and payments with respect thereto.

27

(f) To the extent that the Agent receives funds for application to the amounts owing by any Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement or any Note in currencies other than the currency or currencies required to enable the Agent to distribute funds to the Lenders in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.13, the Agent shall be entitled to convert or exchange such funds into Dollars or into Euros or from Dollars to Euros or from Euros to Dollars, as the case may be, to the extent necessary to enable the Agent to distribute such funds in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.13; p [rovided]{.underline} that each Borrower and each of the Lenders hereby agree that the Agent shall not be liable or responsible for any loss, cost or expense suffered by such Borrower or such Lender as a result of any conversion or exchange of currencies affected pursuant to this Section 2.13(f) or as a result of the failure of the Agent to effect any such conversion or exchange; and p [rovided further]{.underline} that such Borrower agrees to indemnify the Agent and each Lender, and hold the Agent and each Lender harmless, for any and all losses, costs and expenses incurred by the Agent or any Lender for any conversion or exchange of currencies (or the failure to convert or exchange any currencies) in accordance with this Section 2.13(f).

(g) In connection with the use or administration of any Benchmark, the Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement. The Agent will promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use or administration of any Benchmark.

### Section 2.14 [Taxes]{.underline}.

(a) Each Lender is exempt from any withholding tax imposed under the laws of the United States in respect of any fees, interest or other payments to which it is entitled pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes (the "[Income]{.underline}") because (i) the Lender is a United States Person; (ii) the Income is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business within the United States within the meaning of Section 871 of the Internal Revenue Code; or (iii) the Income is eligible for an exemption by reason of a tax treaty. The Agent is exempt from any withholding tax imposed under the laws of the United States in respect of the Income because the Agent is a United States Person.

(b) Each Lender that is a United States Person shall, on or prior to the date it becomes a party hereto and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Company or the Agent, provide the Agent and the relevant Borrower with a properly completed and duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, or any successor or other form provided by the Internal Revenue Service. Each Lender that is not a United States Person (each, a "[Fore]{.underline}ig[n Lender]{.underline}") shall, on or prior to the date it becomes a party hereto and from time to time thereafter if requested in writing by the Company or the Agent, provide the Agent and the relevant Borrower with a properly completed and duly executed Internal Revenue Service Form W- 8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI or W-8IMY (accompanied by Internal Revenue Service Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-9 or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as appropriate), as appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, certifying that such Foreign Lender is exempt from or entitled to a reduced rate of United States withholding tax on any Income that is the subject of such forms. If the relevant Borrower determines, based on the form provided by a Foreign Lender (or the failure to provide such a form) at the time such Foreign Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement that a United States withholding tax rate in excess of zero applies to payments made by such Borrower to the Foreign Lender under this Agreement, such Borrower shall be permitted to deduct amounts from payments to such Foreign Lender to the extent required to pay withholding tax at such rate, and such amounts shall be considered excluded from Taxes as defined in Section 2.14(c); p [rovided, however]{.underline}, that, if on the date of the Assignment and Assumption pursuant to which a Foreign Lender becomes a Foreign Lender, pursuant to the Assignment and Assumption provisions of Article VIII, the Foreign Lender assignor was entitled to payments under Section 2.14(c) in respect of United States withholding tax paid at such date, then, to such extent, the term Taxes shall include (in addition to Taxes that are imposed pursuant to a Change in Law (defined below) after the date of Assignment and Assumption) United States withholding tax, if any, applicable with respect to the Foreign Lender assignee on such date. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligations of any Borrower under Section 2.14 of this Agreement shall not be increased as the result of any assignment pursuant to Article VIII of this Agreement with respect to United States withholding tax; p [rovided]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, that the foregoing shall not limit the obligation of any Borrower in respect of Taxes imposed as the result of any Change in Law after the date of the relevant Assignment and Assumption.

28

(c) Except as set forth in Section 2.14(b) or as required by applicable law, any and all payments by any Borrower hereunder or under the Notes shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any withholding taxes imposed on a Lender (such withholding taxes being hereinafter referred to as "Taxes", which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall exclude any Excluded Taxes). If any Borrower is required to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of any Income, then: (i) the sum payable to such Lender shall be increased as may be necessary so that after making all required deductions for such Taxes (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.14) such Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with applicable law. Within 30 days after the date of any payment of Taxes by the Company pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Company shall furnish to the Agent, at its address referred to in Section 8.02, the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Borrower shall be entitled to pay any Taxes in any lawful manner so as to reduce any deductions and such Lender shall to the extent it is reasonably able provide any documentation or file any forms as may be required by the Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental agency. In addition, if any Lender or the Agent (in lieu of such Lender), as the case may be, is required to pay directly any Taxes because a Borrower cannot or does not legally or timely do so, the Company shall indemnify such Lender or Agent for payment of such Taxes, without duplication of, or increase in, the amount in respect of Taxes otherwise due to the Lender.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the sum payable to a Lender shall not be increased, and no indemnification payments shall be made, pursuant to Section 2.14(c) with respect to any United States federal withholding taxes any Borrower is required to deduct from or in respect of any Income, except to the extent that (i) such Borrower is required to deduct such taxes as a result of the enactment, promulgation, execution or ratification of, or any change in or amendment to, any United States law or any tax treaty (or in the application or official interpretation of any law or any tax treaty) that occurs after the date a Lender first becomes a party to this Agreement (a "[Change in Law]{.underline}") or (ii) such taxes are "Taxes" solely as a result of the application of the proviso to the penultimate sentence of Section 2.14(b).

(e) In addition, the Company agrees to pay any present or future stamp or documentary taxes or any other excise or property taxes, charges or similar levies (excluding any income or franchise taxes, business taxes or capital taxes of any nature) that arise from the execution or delivery, or otherwise with respect to, this Agreement or the Notes (hereinafter referred to as "[Other Taxes]{.underline}"). If a Lender is required to pay directly Other Taxes because a Borrower cannot or does not legally or timely do so, the Company shall indemnify such Lender for such payment of Other Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.14, each Lender shall upon the written request of and at the expense of the Company use reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such Other Taxes that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause imposition on such Lender of any material legal or regulatory burdens.

29

(f) To the extent any Lender is entitled to any exemption or reduction of foreign withholding taxes, each Lender shall cooperate with each Borrower by providing to the extent reasonably within its means any forms requested by such Borrower substantiating such reduction or exemption from such foreign withholding taxes required by any governmental agency.

(g) For any period with respect to which a Lender has failed to comply with the requirements of subsection (b) or (f) relating to certain forms intended to reduce withholding taxes (other than if such failure is due to a Change in Law that makes compliance with subsection (b) or

\(f\) unduly burdensome in the reasonable judgment of such Lender), such Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section 2.14.

(h) Upon a Change in Law or the imposition of any Taxes, a Lender shall, upon the written request of and at the expense of the Company, use reasonable efforts to change the jurisdiction of its Applicable Lending Office if the making of such a change would avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, any such Taxes that may thereafter accrue and would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, cause the imposition on such Lender of any material legal or regulatory burdens.

(i) Any request by any Lender for payment of any amount under this Section 2.14 shall be accompanied by a certification that such Lender's claim for said amount is generally consistent with such Lender's treatment of similarly situated customers of such Lender whose transactions with such Lender are similarly affected by the change in circumstances giving rise to such payment, but such Lender shall not be required to disclose any confidential or proprietary information therein.

(j) If any Lender shall become aware, including by means of a request by the Company, that it is entitled to receive a refund (including, for all purposes of this subsection (j), any refund in the form of a credit from the jurisdiction imposing such Taxes or Other Taxes) in respect of Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.14, or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14, it shall promptly notify such Borrower of the availability of such refund and shall, within 30 days after receipt of a request by the Company (whether as a result of notification that it has made to a Borrower or otherwise) to seek such refund, make a claim for such refund at such Borrower's expense. No Lender shall seek a refund without such approval by a Borrower. If a Lender receives a refund in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.14, or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.14, it shall promptly notify such Borrower of such refund and shall within 30 days from the date of receipt of such refund pay over the amount of such refund to such Borrower to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section 2.14 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund plus any interest paid or credited with respect to such refund, net of all out-of-pocket expenses and net of any loss or gain realized in the conversion of such funds from one to another currency incurred by the Agent of such Lender; p [rovided]{.underline} that the applicable Borrower, upon the request of the Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed with respect to such Taxes or Other Taxes by the relevant governmental agency) to the Agent or such Lender in the event the Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such governmental agency. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it reasonably deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.

30

(k) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this subsection (k), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions of this Section 2.14 shall be the only provisions requiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to bear the cost of (or arising from) any taxes otherwise borne by any Lender. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "taxes" includes any tax, governmental fee or other like assessment or charge of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, withholding on amounts paid to or by the Company or its Subsidiaries), together with any interest, penalty, addition to tax or additional amount imposed with respect thereto.

### Section 2.15 [Sharing]{.underline} [of Payments, Etc]{.underline}.

If any Lender shall obtain any payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Revolving Credit Advances owing to it (other than pursuant to Section 2.05(b), 2.06(b), 2.11, 2.14, 8.04(c) or 8.07), or the participations in Swing Line Advances held by it, in excess of its ratable share thereof, such Lender shall forthwith purchase from the other Lenders such participations in the Revolving Credit Advances and subparticipations in the Swing Line Advances owing to them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Lender to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; p [rovided]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter recovered from such purchasing Lender, such purchase from each Lender shall be rescinded and such Lender shall repay to the purchasing Lender the purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such Lender's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the purchasing Lender) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the purchasing Lender in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation or subparticipation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 2.15 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such participation or subparticipation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation or subparticipation.

### Section 2.16 [Use of Proceeds]{.underline}.

The proceeds of the Advances shall be available (and the Company agrees that such proceeds shall be used) for general corporate purposes of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including but not limited to working capital, capital investments and acquisitions. No Borrower shall knowingly use the proceeds of any Advance to fund any activities or business (a) of or with any individual or entity that is included on the SDN List or (b) in, or with the government of, any Sanctioned Country, except in the case of (a) or (b) to the extent licensed by OFAC or otherwise permissible under U.S. law.

31

### Section 2.17 [Borrowings by Borrowing]{.underline} [Subsidiaries]{.underline}.

(a) The Company may, at any time or from time to time upon not less than 10 Business Days' notice in the case of any Subsidiary so designated after the Effective Date, designate one or more Subsidiaries as Borrowers hereunder by furnishing to the Agent a letter (a "[Des]{.underline}ig[nation Letter]{.underline}") in duplicate, in substantially the form of Exhibit D, duly completed and executed by the Company and such Subsidiary. The Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the Company's notice of such pending designation by the Company and the identity of the Subsidiary. Following the giving of any notice pursuant to this Section 2.17(a), if the designation of such Subsidiary obligates the Agent or any Lender to comply with "know your customer" or similar identification procedures (including without limitation the Beneficial Ownership Regulation) in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Company shall, promptly upon the request of the Agent or any Lender, supply such documentation and other evidence as is reasonably requested by the Agent or any Lender in order for the Agent or such Lender to carry out and be satisfied it has complied with the results of all necessary "know your customer" or other similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations. Upon any such designation of a Subsidiary, such Subsidiary shall be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a Borrower entitled to borrow Revolving Credit Advances on and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

If the Company shall designate as a Borrowing Subsidiary hereunder any Subsidiary not organized under the laws of the United States or any State thereof, any Lender may, with notice to the Agent and the Company, fulfill its Commitment(s) by causing an Affiliate or a branch of such Lender to act as the Lender in respect of such Borrowing Subsidiary.

As soon as practicable after receiving notice from the Company or the Agent of the Company's intent to designate a Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary, and in any event no later than five Business Days after the delivery of such notice, if such Borrowing Subsidiary is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than of the United States or a political subdivision thereof, any Lender that may not legally lend to, establish credit for the account of and/or do any business whatsoever with such Borrowing Subsidiary directly or through an Affiliate or a branch of such Lender as provided in the immediately preceding paragraph (a "[Protesting]{.underline} [Lender]{.underline}") shall so notify the Company and the Agent in writing. With respect to each Protesting Lender, the Company shall, effective on or before the date that such Borrowing Subsidiary shall have the right to borrow hereunder, either (A) notify the Agent and such Protesting Lender that the Commitments of such Protesting Lender shall be terminated; p [rovided]{.underline} that such Protesting Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Advances, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee Lender (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company or the relevant Borrowing Subsidiary (in the case of all other amounts), or (B) cancel its request to designate such Subsidiary as a "Borrowing Subsidiary" hereunder.

(b) If all principal of and interest on all Advances made to any Borrowing Subsidiary have been paid in full, the Company may terminate the status of such Borrowing Subsidiary as a Borrower hereunder by furnishing to the Agent a letter (a "[Termination Letter]{.underline}") in substantially the form of Exhibit E, duly completed and executed by the Company. Any Termination Letter furnished hereunder shall be effective upon receipt by the Agent, which shall promptly notify the Lenders, whereupon the Lenders shall, upon payment in full of all amounts owing by such Borrower hereunder, promptly deliver to the Company (through the Agent) the Notes, if any, of such former Borrower. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the delivery of a Termination Letter with respect to any Borrower shall not terminate (i) any obligation of such Borrower that remains unpaid at the time of such delivery (including without limitation any obligation arising thereafter in respect of such Borrower under Section 2.11 or 2.14) or (ii) the obligations of the Company under Article IX with respect to any such unpaid obligations; provided that if the status of such Borrowing Subsidiary has been terminated as aforesaid because the Company has sold or transferred its interest in such Subsidiary, and the Company so certifies to the Agent at the time of the delivery of such Termination Letter, and subject to payment of said principal and interest,

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
(A) such Subsidiary shall automatically, upon the effectiveness of the delivery of such Termination Letter and certification, cease to have any obligation under this Agreement or the Notes and (B) the Company shall automatically be deemed to have unconditionally assumed, as primary obligor, and hereby agrees to pay and perform, all of such obligations.

32

### Section 2.18 [Benchmark Replacement Setting]{.underline}.

a.  [Benchmark Replacement]{.underline}. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred prior to any setting of any Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (a) of the definition of "Benchmark Replacement" for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and the definition of "Adjusted Term SOFR" shall be deemed modified to delete clause (b) for any calculation of Term SOFR and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (b) of the definition of "Benchmark Replacement" for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00

p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Benchmark Replacement from Lenders comprising the Required Lenders. If the Benchmark Replacement is Daily Simple SOFR, all interest payments will be payable on a monthly basis.

b.  [Benchmark Replacement Conforming]{.underline} [Changes]{.underline}. In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.

c.  [Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations]{.underline}. The Agent will promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of (i) any Benchmark Replacement Date and the related Benchmark Replacement, (ii) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes, (iii) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to clause (d) below and (iv) the commencement or conclusion of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. For the avoidance of doubt, any notice required to be delivered by the Agent as set forth in this Section 2.18 may be provided, at the option of the Agent (in its sole discretion), in one or more notices and may be delivered together with, or as part of any amendment which implements any Benchmark Replacement or Conforming Changes. Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Agent or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.18, including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.18.

d.  [Unavailabili]{.underline}ty [of Tenor of Benchmark]{.underline}. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate or the EURIBO Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Agent in its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is or will be no longer representative, then the Agent may modify the definition of "Interest Period" for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Agent may modify the definition of "Interest Period" for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.

33

e.  [Benchmark Unavailabili]{.underline}ty [Period]{.underline}. Upon the Company's receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to a given Benchmark, (i) the Borrowers may revoke any pending request for a Term SOFR Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Advances, or a Borrowing of, or continuation of, Eurocurrency Rate Advances, in each case, to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period denominated in the applicable Available Currency and, failing that, (A) in the case of any request for any affected Term SOFR Borrowing, if applicable, the applicable Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Base Rate Borrowing or conversion to Base Rate Advances in the amount specified therein and (B) in the case of any request for any affected Eurocurrency Rate Borrowing or Swing Line Borrowing, then such request shall be ineffective and (ii)(A) any outstanding affected Term SOFR Advances, if applicable, will be deemed to have been converted into Base Rate Advances at the end of the applicable Interest Period and (B) any outstanding affected Eurocurrency Rate Advances, at the applicable Borrower's election, shall either (I) be converted into Base Rate Advances denominated in Dollars (in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent thereof) at the end of the applicable Interest Period or (II) be prepaid in full at the end of the applicable Interest Period; p [rovided]{.underline} that, with respect to any Eurocurrency Rate Advance, if no election is made by the applicable Borrower by the earlier of (x) the date that is three Business Days after receipt by such Borrower of such notice and (y) the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Advance, such Borrower shall be deemed to have elected clause (I) above. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the applicable Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 8.04(c). During a Benchmark Unavailability Period with respect to any Benchmark or at any time that a tenor for any then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark that is the subject of such Benchmark Unavailability Period or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Base Rate.

f.  [Certain Defined Terms]{.underline}. As used in this Section 2.18: "[Available Currency]{.underline}" means Dollars or Euros.

"[Available Tenor]{.underline}" means, as of any date of determination and with respect to the then-current Benchmark, as applicable, for an Available Currency, (x) if such Benchmark is a term rate, any tenor for such Benchmark (or component thereof) that is or may be used for determining the length of an interest period pursuant to this Agreement, as of such date and not including, for the avoidance of doubt, any tenor for such Benchmark that is then- removed from the definition of "Interest Period" pursuant to clause (d) of this Section 2.18.

"[Benchmark]{.underline}" means, initially, the Relevant Rate; p [rovided]{.underline} that if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred with respect to such Relevant Rate or the then-current Benchmark, then "Benchmark" means the applicable Benchmark Replacement to the extent that such Benchmark Replacement has replaced such prior benchmark rate pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 2.18.

34

"[Benchmark Replacement]{.underline}" means, with respect to any Benchmark Transition Event for any then-current Benchmark the first alternative set forth in the order below that can be determined by the Agent for the applicable Benchmark Replacement Date; p [rovided]{.underline}, that in the case of Advances denominated in Euros, the "Benchmark Replacement" shall mean the alternative set forth in clause (b) below:

(a) with respect to Term SOFR Advances, Daily Simple SOFR *plus* 0.10%; or

(b) the sum of: (1) the alternate benchmark rate that has been selected by the Agent and the Company as the replacement for the then-current Benchmark giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation of a replacement benchmark rate or the mechanism for determining such a rate by the Relevant Governmental Body or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a benchmark rate as a replacement for such Benchmark for syndicated credit facilities denominated in the applicable Available Currency at such time and (2) the related Benchmark Replacement Adjustment;

p [rovided]{.underline} that, if such Benchmark Replacement as so determined would be less than the Floor, such Benchmark Replacement will be deemed to be the Floor for the purposes of this Agreement.

"[Benchmark Replacement Ad]{.underline}j[ustment]{.underline}" means, with respect to any replacement of any then-current Benchmark with an Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement, the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment (which may be a positive or negative value or zero) that has been selected by the Agent and the Company giving due consideration to (a) any selection or recommendation of a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement by the Relevant Governmental Body or (b) any evolving or then-prevailing market convention for determining a spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the replacement of such Benchmark with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for syndicated credit facilities denominated in the applicable Available Currency at such time.

"[Benchmark Replacement Date]{.underline}" means the earliest to occur of the following events with respect to the then-current Benchmark for any Available Currency:

(1) in the case of clause (1) or (2) of the definition of "Benchmark Transition Event," the later of (a) the date of the public statement or publication of information referenced therein and (b) the date on which the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) permanently or indefinitely ceases to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof); or

(2) in the case of clause (3) of the definition of "Benchmark Transition Event", the first date on which such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) has been determined and announced by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) to be non-representative; p [rovided]{.underline} that such non-representativeness will be determined by reference to the most recent statement or publication referenced in such clause (c) and even if any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) continues to be provided on such date.

35

For the avoidance of doubt, the "Benchmark Replacement Date" will be deemed to have occurred in the case of clause (1) or (2) with respect to any Benchmark upon the occurrence of the applicable event or events set forth therein with respect to all then-current Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof).

"[Benchmark Transition Event]{.underline}" means, with respect to the then-current Benchmark for any Available Currency, the occurrence of one or more of the following events with respect to such Benchmark:

(1) a public statement or publication of information by or on behalf of the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) announcing that such administrator has ceased or will cease to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof), permanently or indefinitely, p [rovided]{.underline} that, at the time of such statement or publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof);

(2) a public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof), the Relevant Governmental Body, an insolvency official with jurisdiction over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component), a resolution authority with jurisdiction over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component) or a court or an entity with similar insolvency or resolution authority over the administrator for such Benchmark (or such component), which states that the administrator of such Benchmark (or such component) has ceased or will cease to provide all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) permanently or indefinitely, p [rovided]{.underline} that, at the time of such statement or publication, there is no successor administrator that will continue to provide any Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or such component thereof); or

(3) a public statement or publication of information by the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof) announcing that all Available Tenors of such Benchmark (or such component thereof) are no longer representative.

For the avoidance of doubt, a "Benchmark Transition Event" will be deemed to have occurred with respect to any Benchmark if a public statement or publication of information set forth above has occurred with respect to each then-current Available Tenor of such Benchmark (or the published component used in the calculation thereof).

"[Benchmark Unavailabili]{.underline}ty [Period]{.underline}" means, with respect to any then-current Benchmark for any Available Currency, the period (if any)

### Section 2.19 [Defaulting]{.underline} [Lenders]{.underline}.

(a) [Defaulting]{.underline} [Lender Ad]{.underline}j[ustments]{.underline}. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:

    i.  [Waivers and Amendments]{.underline}. Such Defaulting Lender's right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.

    ii. [Defaulting]{.underline} [Lender Waterfall]{.underline}. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Agent hereunder for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VI or otherwise) or received by the Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 8.05 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Agent as follows: *first*, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent hereunder; *second*, as the Company may request (so long as no Default exists), to the funding of any Advance in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent; *third*, if so determined by the Agent and the Company, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender's potential future funding obligations with respect to Advances under this Agreement; *fourth*, so long as no Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Company as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Company against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and *fifth*, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; p [rovided]{.underline} that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Advances in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Advances were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Advances of all Non- Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Advances owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Revolving Credit Advances are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Revolving Credit Commitments. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.19 shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

37

iii. [Commitment Fees]{.underline}. No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any Commitment Fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Company shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender).

iv. All or any part of such Defaulting Lender's participation in Swing Line Advances shall be reallocated among the Non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective ratable portion thereof (calculated on the Revolving Credit Commitments but without regard to such Defaulting Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment) but only to the extent that such reallocation does not cause such Non-Defaulting Lender's aggregate principal amount of outstanding Revolving Credit Advances plus such Non-Defaulting Lender's participation in Swing Line Advances to exceed such Non-Defaulting Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment. Subject to Section 8.15, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non-Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non- Defaulting Lender's increased exposure following such reallocation.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
(b) If the reallocation described in clause (a)(iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to it hereunder or under applicable law, prepay all outstanding Swing Line Advances.

(c) [Defaulting]{.underline} [Lender Cure]{.underline}. If the Company, the Agent and each Swing Line Lender agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Revolving Credit Advances of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Revolving Credit Advances to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with the Revolving Credit Commitments, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; p [rovided]{.underline} that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Company while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and p [rovided]{.underline}, [further]{.underline}, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender's having been a Defaulting Lender.

### Section 2.20. The Swing Line Advances

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Swing Line Lender severally agrees to make a portion of the credit otherwise available from time to time to the Borrowers by making swing line advances ("[Swing]{.underline} [Line Advances]{.underline}") on any Business Day during the period from the Effective Date until the Termination Date applicable to such Swing Line Lender to the Borrower requesting such extension of credit under subsection (b) of this Section 2.20. Such Swing Line Advances shall be denominated in Euros and, in the aggregate, shall not exceed

\(x\) at any time outstanding (i) for each Swing Line Lender (1) such Swing Line Lender's Swing Line Commitment then in effect and (2) when aggregated to such Swing Line Lender's outstanding Revolving Credit Advances and such Swing Line Lender's unfunded participations in Swing Line Advances made by any other Swing Line Lender, such Swing Line Lender's Revolving Credit Commitment then in effect and (ii) for all Swing Line Advances, the amount of the Swing Line Sublimit or (y) at the time of such Swing Line Advance, the aggregate Unused Revolving Credit Commitments of the Lenders. Within the foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers may borrow under this Section 2.20, prepay Swing Line Advances under Section 2.10 or repay Swing Line Advances under Section 2.06(a), and reborrow under this Section 2.20. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Advance, each Lender shall be deemed to have purchased, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to purchase, from the applicable Swing Line Lender a risk participation in such Swing Line Advance in an amount equal to such Lender's ratable share of such Swing Line Advance.

38

(b) Each Swing Line Advance shall be made on notice to the Sub-Agent, given not later than 9:30 A.M. (London time) on the Business Day on which the proposed Swing Line Advance is to be made. Such notice requirement shall be satisfied by the delivery of a Notice of Borrowing for such Swing Line Advance by e-mail and such notice shall specify therein (A) the requested date of such Swing Line Advance (which shall be a Business Day), (B) the requested aggregate amount of Swing Line Advances being requested by such Borrower and (C) the requested account to which the proceeds of the requested Swing Line Advance are to be transferred. The Sub-Agent will promptly advise the Swing Line Lenders of any such notice received from a Borrower. Each Swing Line Lender shall make its ratable portion of the requested Swing Line Advance (such ratable portion to be calculated based upon such Swing Line Lender's Swing Line Commitment to the total Swing Line Commitments of all of the Swing Line Lenders) available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Sub-Agent at the account designated by the Sub-Agent, in same day funds, before 1:00 P.M. (London time) on the date a Borrower has requested such Swing Line Advance. After the Sub-Agent's receipt of such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article III, the Sub-Agent will make such funds available to such Borrower by transferring the amount thereof to the account designated by such Borrower for such purpose on the date specified in such Notice of Borrowing.

(c) The failure of any Swing Line Lender to make the Swing Line Advance to be made by it as part of any Swing Line Borrowing shall not relieve any other Swing Line Lender of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Swing Line Advance on the date of such Swing Line Borrowing, but no Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Swing Line Lender to make the Swing Line Advance to be made by such other Lender on the date of any Swing Line Borrowing.

(d) Upon written demand by a Swing Line Lender, with a copy of such demand to the Agent, each other Lender will purchase from such Swing Line Lender, and such Swing Line Lender shall sell and assign to each such other Lender, such other Lender's ratable portion of such outstanding Swing Line Advance, by making available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the Agent for the account of such Swing Line Lender, by deposit to the Agent's Account, in same day funds, an amount equal to the portion of the outstanding principal amount of such Swing Line Advance to be purchased by such Lender. Each Borrower hereby agrees to each such sale and assignment. Each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, promptly upon receipt of such notice from the Agent, to purchase its ratable portion of an outstanding Swing Line Advance on the third Business Day after the date demand therefor. Each Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire by assignment Swing Line Advances pursuant to this paragraph is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Upon any such assignment by any Swing Line Lender to any other Lender of a portion of a Swing Line Advance, such Swing Line Lender represents and warrants to such other Lender that such Swing Line Lender is the legal and beneficial owner of such interest being assigned by it, but makes no other representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to such Swing Line Advance, this Agreement, the Notes or the Borrowers. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have so made the amount of such Swing Line Advance available to the Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such Lender is required to have made such amount available to the Agent until the date such amount is paid to the Agent, at the higher of the Overnight Rate and the cost of funds incurred by the Agent in respect of such amount, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Agent in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender shall pay to the Agent such amount for the account of such Swing Line Lender on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute a Swing Line Advance made by such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement, and the outstanding principal amount of the Swing Line Advance made by such Swing Line Lender shall be reduced by such amount on such Business Day.

39

(e) At any time after any Lender has funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Advance, if any Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing Line Advance, such Swing Line Lender will promptly distribute to such Lender its ratable share thereof in the same funds as those received by such Swing Line Lender.

(f) Unless the Sub-Agent shall have received notice from a Swing Line Lender prior to the time of any Swing Line Borrowing that such Swing Line Lender will not make available to the Sub-Agent such Swing Line Lender's ratable share of such Swing Line Borrowing, the Sub-Agent may assume that such Swing Line Lender has made such portion available to the Sub-Agent on the date of such Swing Line Borrowing in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 2.20 and the Sub-Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower requesting such Swing Line Borrowing on such date, a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Swing Line Lender shall not have so made such ratable portion available to the Sub-Agent, such Swing Line Lender and such Borrower severally agree to repay to the Sub-Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount, together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to such Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Sub-Agent at (i) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to Swing Line Advances and (ii) in the case of such Swing Line Lender, the Overnight Rate. If such Swing Line Lender shall repay to the Sub-Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Swing Line Lender's Swing Line Advance as part of such Swing Line Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

## ARTICLE VII THE AGENT

### Section 7.01 [A]{.underline}p pointment and Authority.

Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Citibank, N.A. to act on its behalf as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Except as expressly provided herein, the provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrowers shall not have rights as a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term "agent" herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. The Agent agrees to give to each Lender prompt notice of each notice given to it by the Company pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

48

### Section 7.02 [R]{.underline}ig[hts as a Lender]{.underline}.

The Person serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender" or "Lenders" shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with, the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders.

### Section 7.03 [Exculpatory Provisions]{.underline}.

(a) The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent:

    i.  shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;

    ii. shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents); p [rovided]{.underline} that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any debtor relief law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any debtor relief law; and

    iii. shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Affiliates that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

(b) The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 8.01 and 6.01), or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the Agent in writing by the Company or a Lender.

(c) The Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article III or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Agent.

49

### Section 7.04 [Reliance by Agent]{.underline}.

The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of an Advance that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender unless the Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Advance. The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

### Section 7.05 [Indemnification]{.underline}.

The Lenders agree to indemnify the Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Company), ratably according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Revolving Credit Advances then made by each of them (or if no Revolving Credit Advances are at the time outstanding, ratably according to the respective amounts of their Revolving Credit Commitments), from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever that may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any action taken or omitted by the Agent under this Agreement; p [rovided]{.underline} that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the Agent's gross negligence, willful misconduct or material breach of this Agreement in bad faith. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses (including counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or responsibilities under, this Agreement, to the extent that the Agent is not reimbursed for such expenses by the Company.

### Section 7.06 [Delegation of Duties]{.underline}.

The Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent and approved by the Company. The Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub- agent and to the Related Parties of the Agent and any such sub-agent. The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub- agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non appealable judgment that the Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. The Sub-Agent has been designated under this Agreement to carry out only those duties as are specified herein. The Sub-Agent shall be subject to each of the obligations in this Agreement to be performed by the Sub-Agent, and each of the Borrowers and the Lenders agrees that the Sub-Agent shall be entitled to exercise each of the rights and shall be entitled to each of the benefits of the Agent under this Agreement as such rights and benefits relate to the performance of its obligations hereunder.

50

### Section 7.07 [Res]{.underline}ig[nation of Agent]{.underline}.

(a) The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Company. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor approved by the Company, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the "[Res]{.underline}ig[nation Effective Date]{.underline}"), then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.

(b) If the Person serving as Agent is a Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (e) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Company and such Person remove such Person as Agent and appoint a successor approved by the Company. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the "[Removal Effective Date]{.underline}"), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.

(c) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (2) all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, p [owers]{.underline}, privileges and duties of the retiring or removed Agent, and the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the retiring or removed Agent's resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article (and, as to the Agent, Section 8.04) shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring or removed Agent was acting as Agent.

(d) Any resignation pursuant to this Section by a Person acting as Agent shall, unless such Person shall notify the Borrowers and the Lenders otherwise, also act to relieve such Person and its Affiliates of any obligation to advance Swing Line Advances where such advance is to occur on or after the effective date of such resignation. Upon the acceptance of a successor's appointment as Agent hereunder, (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Swing Line Lender, (ii) the retiring Swing Line Lender shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, (iii) the successor Swing Line Lender shall enter into an Assignment and Assumption and acquire from the retiring Swing Line Lender each outstanding Swing Line Advance of such retiring Swing Line Lender for a purchase price equal to par plus accrued interest.

51

### Section 7.08 [Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders]{.underline}.

Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

### Section 7.09 [Syndication Agent and Lead Arrangers]{.underline}.

Without prejudice to the obligations of the Agent and the Sub-Agent hereunder, the Syndication Agent and Lead Arrangers, in their capacities as such, have no duties, obligations or responsibilities under this Agreement.

### Section 7.10 [Certain ERISA Matters]{.underline}.

(a) Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Agent and each Lead Arranger, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of any Borrower, that at least one of the following is and will be true:

### Section 7.11 [Erroneous Payments]{.underline}.

(a) If the Agent notifies a Lender, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender (any such Lender or other recipient, a "[Payment Recipient]{.underline}") that the Agent has determined in its sole discretion (whether or not after receipt of any notice under immediately succeeding clause (b)) that any funds received by such Payment Recipient from the Agent or any of its Affiliates were erroneously transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by, such Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Lender or other Payment Recipient on its behalf) (any such funds, whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise, individually and collectively, an "[Erroneous]{.underline} [Payment]{.underline}") and demands the return of such Erroneous Payment (or a portion thereof), such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of the Agent and shall be segregated by the Payment Recipient and held in trust for the benefit of the Agent, and such Lender shall (or, with respect to any Payment Recipient who received such funds on its behalf, shall cause such Payment Recipient to) promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter, return to the Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made, in same day funds (in the currency so received), together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to the Agent in same day funds at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect. A notice of the Agent to any Payment Recipient under this clause (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

53

(b) Without limiting the immediately preceding clause (a), each Lender, or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender, hereby further agrees that if it receives a payment, prepayment or repayment (whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise) from the Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Agent (or any of its Affiliates), or

\(z\) that such Lender, or such other recipient, otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) in each case:

i.  \(A\) in the case of immediately preceding clauses (x) or (y), an error shall be presumed to have been made (absent written confirmation from the Agent to the contrary) or (B) an error has been made (in the case of immediately preceding clause (z)), in each case, with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment; and

ii. such Lender shall (and shall cause any other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to) promptly (and, in all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of such error) notify the Agent of its receipt of such payment, prepayment or repayment, the details thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Agent pursuant to this Section 7.11(b).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
(c) Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off, net and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Agent to such Lender from any source, against any amount due to the Agent under immediately preceding clause (a) or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement.

(d) In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by the Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (a), from any Lender that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and/or from any Payment Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) on its respective behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an "[Erroneous]{.underline} [Payment Return Deficiency]{.underline}"), upon the Agent's notice to such Lender at any time, (i) such Lender shall be deemed to have assigned its Advances (but not its Commitments) in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Agent may specify) (such assignment of such Advances (but not Commitments), the "[Erroneous Payment Deficiency Ass]{.underline}ig[nment]{.underline}") at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest (with the assignment fee to be waived by the Agent in such instance), and is hereby (together with the Company) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment and Assumption (or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference pursuant to an approved electronic platform as to which the Agent and such parties are participants) to the Agent, as the assignee Lender, with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and such Lender shall deliver any Notes evidencing such Advances to the Borrowers or the Agent, (ii) the Agent as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to acquire the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, (iii) upon such deemed acquisition, the Agent as the assignee Lender shall become a Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the assigning Lender shall cease to be a Lender hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender and (iv) the Agent may reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the Advances subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment. The Agent may sell any Advances acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment in accordance with Section 8.07 hereof (pursuant to which the prior written consent of the Company is required for any such sale (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)), and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Advance (or portion thereof), and the Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and claims against such Lender (and/or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf). For the avoidance of doubt, no Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender and such Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In addition, each party hereto agrees that, except to the extent that the Agent has sold an Advance (or portion thereof) acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and irrespective of whether the Agent may be equitably subrogated, the Agent shall be contractually subrogated to all the rights and interests of the applicable Lender under the Loan Documents with respect to each Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency (the "[Erroneous Payment Subrogation R]{.underline}ig[hts]{.underline}").

54

(e) The parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any obligations owed by any Borrower, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, or any portion of such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Agent from any Borrower for the purpose of making a payment, prepayment, repayment, discharge or satisfaction in respect of the obligations under any Loan Document. For the avoidance of doubt, clause (d) above and this clause (e) shall not be interpreted to increase (or accelerate the due date for), or have the effect of increasing (or accelerating the due date for), the obligations of any Borrower relative to the amount (and/or timing for payment) of the obligations of any Borrower that would have been payable had the Erroneous Payment not been made by the Agent.

(f) To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of set-off or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Agent for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on "discharge for value" or any similar doctrine

(g) Each party's obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 7.11 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations of any Borrower (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a "[Granting]{.underline} [Lender]{.underline}") may grant to a special purpose vehicle (an "[SPV]{.underline}") of such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to time by the Granting Lender to the Agent and the Company, the option to provide to the Borrowers all or any part of any Advance that such Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrowers pursuant to Section 2.01, p [rovided]{.underline} that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment by any SPV to make any Advance, (ii) if an SPV elects not to exercise such option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Advance, the Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Advance pursuant to the terms hereof and (iii) the Borrowers may bring any proceeding against either the Granting Lender or the SPV in order to enforce any rights of the Borrowers hereunder. The making of an Advance by an SPV hereunder shall utilize the Commitment of the Granting Lender to the same extent, and as if, such Advance were made by the Granting Lender.

FORM OF REVOLVING CREDIT NOTE

U.S.$

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, PEPSICO, INC., a North Carolina corporation (the "[Borrower]{.underline}"), HEREBY PROMISES TO PAY to the order of (the "[Lender]{.underline}") for the account of its Applicable Lending Office on the Termination Date (each as defined in the Credit Agreement referred to below) the principal amount of the Revolving Credit Advances made by the Lender to the Borrower pursuant to the Five-Year Credit Agreement dated as of May 26, 2023 among the Borrower, the Lender and certain other lenders parties thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as Agent for the Lender and such other lenders (as amended or modified from time to time, the "[Credit Agreement]{.underline}"; the terms defined therein being used herein as therein defined) outstanding on the Termination Date.

The Borrower promises to pay interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Credit Advance from the date of such Revolving Credit Advance until such principal amount is paid in full, at such interest rates, and payable at such times, as are specified in the Credit Agreement.

Both principal and interest in respect of each Advance (i) denominated in Dollars are payable in lawful money of the United States of America and

\(ii\) denominated in Euros are payable in such currency, in each case to Citibank, N.A., as Agent, at the Agent's Account, in same day funds for the account of the Lender. Each Revolving Credit Advance owing to the Lender by the Borrower pursuant to the Credit Agreement, and all payments made on account of principal thereof, shall be recorded by the Lender and, prior to any transfer hereof, endorsed on the grid attached hereto which is part of this Promissory Note. Each such endorsement shall constitute p [rima facie]{.underline} evidence of the accuracy of the information so endorsed.

This Promissory Note is one of the Revolving Credit Notes referred to in, and is entitled to the benefits of, the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement, among other things, (i) provides for the making of Revolving Credit Advances by the Lender to the Borrower from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the U.S. dollar amount first above mentioned, the indebtedness of the Borrower resulting from each such Revolving Credit Advance being evidenced by this Promissory Note, (ii) contains provisions for determining the Equivalent in Dollars for Advances denominated in Euros and (iii) contains provisions for acceleration of the maturity hereof upon the happening of certain stated events and also for prepayments on account of principal hereof prior to the maturity hereof upon the terms and conditions therein specified.

The Borrower hereby waives presentment, demand, protest and notice of any kind. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any rights hereunder on the part of the holder hereof shall operate as a waiver of such rights.

This Promissory Note shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
