<p>On August 19, 2022, Foot Locker, Inc. (the “Company”), issued a press release announcing that, as part of a planned succession process, Richard</p>
<p>A. Johnson will step down as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective September 1, 2022. Mary N. Dillon, 61, former Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Ulta Beauty, Inc., has been appointed President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) and the Executive Committee of the Board, each effective September 1, 2022. A copy of the press release is furnished as Exhibit 99.1, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p>Ms. Dillon served as Executive Chair of the Board of Directors of Ulta Beauty, Inc. from June 2021 through June 2022. She previously served as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of Ulta from July 2013 through June 2021. Prior to Ulta, she served as President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of United States Cellular Corporation from 2010 through 2013; and Global Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Vice President of McDonald’s Corporation from 2005 through 2010. Previously, Ms. Dillon held several positions of increasing responsibility at PepsiCo Corporation, including as President of the Quaker Foods division from 2004 through 2005 and as Vice President of Marketing for Gatorade and Quaker Foods from 2002 through 2004. Ms. Dillon also currently serves on the Board of Directors of each of Starbucks Corporation and KKR &amp; Co. Inc. and previously served on the Board of Directors of Target Corporation. Ms. Dillon has no family relationship with any of the Company’s directors or executive officers. Ms. Dillon has no direct or indirect material interest in any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K.</p>
<p>On August 17, 2022, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the “letter agreement”) with Mr. Johnson regarding the transition of his services until his retirement from the Company on a date to be mutually agreed between the Company’s Non-Executive Chair and Mr. Johnson, which will be no earlier than April 1, 2023 and no later than April 15, 2023 (the “retirement date”). The letter agreement provides that he will serve as Executive Chairman of the Board from September 1, 2022 until January 31, 2023 and will serve as Senior Advisor to the Company thereafter through the retirement date. Pursuant to the letter agreement, Mr. Johnson will remain eligible for a bonus under the Company’s annual bonus plan for the 2022 fiscal year. During his term as Senior Advisor, Mr. Johnson’s annual base salary will be reduced to fifty percent (50%) of his base salary in effect as of August 19, 2022. In addition, Mr. Johnson will no longer be eligible receive annual equity awards or to participate in the annual bonus plan for the 2023 fiscal year. Except as modified by the letter agreement, the provisions of Mr. Johnson’s previously-disclosed employment agreement remain materially unchanged. The foregoing description of the letter agreement is a summary of certain terms only and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the letter agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p>In connection with the Ms. Dillon’s appointment by the Board, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Ms. Dillon, dated August 16, 2022 (the “Employment Agreement”), which provides for an employment term commencing August 19, 2022 through January 31, 2026 (or the last day of the Company’s 2025 fiscal year if such date does not fall on January 31, 2026), and her appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective September 1, 2022. The employment term will automatically be extended for additional one-year terms unless either party provides 180 days’ notice of non-renewal. Ms. Dillon will receive a base salary of not less than $1,300,000 annually and will be entitled to participate in all bonus, incentive, and equity plans maintained by the Company for senior executives. Ms. Dillon’s annual bonus opportunity at target under the Company’s annual bonus plan will be 200% of her then-current base salary, prorated with regard to the 2022 fiscal year. Within 30 days of her commencement of employment with the Company, Ms. Dillon will also be provided with a cash sign-on bonus equal to $250,000.</p>
<p>The Employment Agreement provides that Ms. Dillon will be granted certain employment inducement awards, effective August 24, 2022, as follows: (i) a restricted stock unit award (RSUs) with a grant date fair value equal to $2,000,000 (which will vest on the third anniversary of her commencement date), (ii) a transformation grant of performance share units (PSUs) with a grant date fair value equal to $5,000,000 (which will vest based on three years of continued employment and the achievement of performance metrics as determined by the Human Capital and Compensation Committee), and (iii) an annual $8,000,000 grant, pro-rated in respect of the Company’s current fiscal year, consisting of PSUs (60%), RSUs (20%), and non-qualified stock options (20%) generally consistent with the terms applicable to other senior executives of the Company. These awards will be granted outside of the Company’s</p>
<p>2007 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, without shareholder approval as “employment inducement awards” under the NYSE Listed Company Manual Rule 303A.08.</p>
<p>If Ms. Dillon’s employment is terminated by the Company (other than for Cause, death, or disability) or if Ms. Dillon resigns with Good Reason (each as defined in the Employment Agreement), then she would be entitled to the following severance payments and benefits, subject to her execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims: (i) two years’ base salary continuation; (ii) a pro rated bonus under the Company’s annual bonus plan for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs, based on actual performance against the applicable performance goals, and (iii) appropriate outplacement services for one year following termination. In addition, any outstanding equity awards held by Ms. Dillon at the time of termination will be treated in accordance with the terms of the applicable plans and award agreements, provided, however, that with regard to equity awards granted to Ms. Dillon through March 2027 (i) if Ms. Dillon’s employment terminates with the consent of the Board on or after the end of the Company’s fiscal year ending on or about January 31, 2027, Ms. Dillon would become vested in 50% of her then outstanding equity awards, and (ii) if Ms. Dillon’s employment terminates with the consent of the Board on or after the end of the Company’s fiscal year ending on or about January 31, 2028, Ms. Dillon would become vested in 100% of her then outstanding equity awards. If the Company terminates Ms. Dillon’s employment without Cause or if she terminates her employment with Good Reason during the two-year period following a Change in Control (as defined in the Employment Agreement), rather than the severance payments provided for above, she would be entitled to an amount equal to two times the sum of her base salary and target bonus under the Company’s annual bonus plan, payable in a single lump sum within 10 days of such termination of employment. The foregoing description of the Employment Agreement is a summary of certain terms only and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Employment Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.2 hereto, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p>As employees and executive officers of the Company, neither Mr. Johnson nor Ms. Dillon will receive any additional compensation for service on the Board or Board committees.</p>

<p>You and the Company previously entered into a Senior Executive Employment Agreement, dated as of November 6, 2014 (the “<strong>Employment Agreement</strong>”), the terms of which are incorporated by reference herein. To the extent there is a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and of the Employment Agreement, this Agreement shall govern.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><u>Employment Transition Period</u>. You and the Company hereby agree to the following in respect of your retirement from the Company, its subsidiaries, and other corporate affiliates (collectively, the “<strong>Employer</strong>”):</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><u>Service as Executive Chairman</u>. You shall continue to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company through August 31, 2022 (the “<strong>Transition Date</strong>”).

Through the end of the Executive Chairman Term, you will continue to receive your monthly base pay in effect as of the payroll period immediately preceding the date hereof, payable in accordance with the Employer’s pay practices as in effect from time to time. You shall also (A) remain eligible to receive your 2022 award pursuant to the Foot Locker Executive Incentive Cash Compensation Plan (the “<strong>Bonus Plan</strong>”) (without pro-ration), payable at such time as the 2022 Bonus Plan amounts are paid to senior executives of the Company, which will be no later than two and one-half months following the end of the Company’s 2022 fiscal year, and (B) continue to vest in any outstanding awards under the Company’s 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “<strong>Stock Incentive Plan</strong>”) in accordance with the existing terms of such awards.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>During the Executive Chairman Term, you will:</p>
<ol type="1">

<li><p>help transition your current role and responsibilities to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="i">
<li><p>You will not be eligible to receive any Bonus Plan grant in respect of the Company’s 2023 fiscal year or receive any additional equity grants following the date hereof.</p></li>
<li><p>You and the Employer intend that your level of services during the Executive Chairman Term will be more than twenty percent (20%) of the level of services provided by you to the Employer over the thirty six (36) month period preceding the Transition Date, such that you will not have incurred a separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A (“<strong>Section 409A</strong>”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “<strong>Code</strong>”) for purposes of any Employer nonqualified deferred compensation plan in which he participates.</p></li>

<li><p><u>Service as Senior Advisor</u>.</p>
<ol type="i">
<li><p>Commencing February 1, 2023, you will assume the role of Senior Advisor and will continue in such role through a date to be mutually agreed upon by you and the Non-Executive Chair of the Company, which date shall be no earlier than April 1, 2023 and no later than April 15, 2023 (the “<strong>Separation Date</strong>” and such term, the “<strong>Senior Advisor Term</strong>”).

<li><p><u>Retirement Date</u>. You acknowledge and agree that on the Separation Date, your employment with Employer will terminate by reason of your retirement unless earlier (1) terminated by reason of your death, or (2) terminated by the Employer for Cause (as defined in the Employment Agreement). You acknowledge and agree that, in connection with your entering into this Agreement, you hereby waive the right to terminate your employment for “Good Reason.” The Company agrees that any purported termination of your employment by the Company other than for Cause during the Executive Chairman Term and the Senior Advisor Term would constitute a breach of this Agreement and entitle you to receive the benefits and payments set forth in Section 8(d) of the Employment Agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein.</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p><u>Post-Termination Obl</u>ig<u>ations and Restrictive Covenants</u>.</p>

<li><p><u>Non-Solicitation of Employees</u>. You understand and acknowledge that the Employer has expended and continues to expend significant time and expense in recruiting and training its employees and that the loss of employees would cause significant and irreparable harm to the Employer. You therefore further agree not to directly or indirectly solicit, hire, recruit, attempt to hire or recruit, or induce the termination of employment of any employee of the Employer for the remainder of your employment with the Employer and for two (2) years to run consecutively, beginning on the Separation Date.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><u>Cooperation</u>. You and the Employer agree that certain matters in which you have been involved during your employment may need your cooperation with the Employer in the future. Accordingly, for a period of two (2) years after the Separation Date, to the extent reasonably requested by the Employer and upon reasonable advance notice, you shall cooperate with the Employer regarding matters arising out of or related to your service to the Employer. The Employer shall reimburse you for reasonable expenses, excluding legal fees incurred in connection with this cooperation. If the Employer requires your</p></li>
</ol>
<p>3</p>
<p>cooperation during the two (2) year period following the Separation Date, and such cooperation requires more than twenty (20) hours of Employee’s time in total, Employer shall pay you an hourly or per diem fee based on Employee’s base salary as of the Separation Date for documented time spent as a condition to providing such cooperation.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p><u>Certain Communications</u>. You agree that you shall not at any time engage in, make, publish, or communicate to any person or entity in any public forum any defamatory or maliciously false remarks, comments, or statements (“<strong>Disparaging Conduct</strong>”) concerning the Employer or its businesses, or any of its employees, officers, or directors. This commitment does not in any way restrict or impede you from exercising protected rights, including rights under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) or the federal securities laws, including the Dodd-Frank Act, to the extent that such rights cannot be waived by agreement or from complying with any applicable law or regulation or a valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction or an authorized government agency; <em>provided</em> that such compliance does not exceed that required by the law, regulation, or order. You shall promptly provide written notice of any such order to the Employer’s General Counsel at <a href="mailto:sclarke@footlocker.com">sclarke@footlocker.com</a> and at 330 West 34th Street, New York, New York 10001. The Company agrees to instruct, and will use reasonable efforts to cause, members of its senior management and members of the Board of Directors not to engage in any Disparaging Conduct regarding you or your services with the Employer.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Indemnification</u>. In addition to the coverage provided to you by the Company’s directors and officers liability policy, during the Executive Chairman Term and the Senior Advisor Term, the Company will indemnify you to the same extent as you were indemnified by the Company prior to the Transition Date in respect of your employment as President and Chief Executive Officer.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Legal Fees</u>. Subject to Section 11, the Company will reimburse you for your reasonable legal fees incurred in connection with the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement up to a total of $25,000.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Successors and Ass</u>ig<u>ns</u>. The Employer may freely assign this Agreement at any time. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Employer and its successors and assigns. You may not assign this Agreement in whole or in part. Any purported assignment by you shall be null and void from the initial date of the purported assignment.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Venue</u>. This Agreement, and all matters arising out of or relating to this Agreement, and your employment or termination of employment with Employer, for all purposes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York, without regard to any conflicts of laws principles that would require the laws of any other jurisdiction to apply.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Entire Agreement</u>. Unless specifically provided herein, this Agreement contains all of the understandings and representations between the Employer and you relating to your separation of employment and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, discussions, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding such subject matter; <em>provided, however</em>, that nothing in this Agreement modifies,</p></li>
</ol>
<p>4</p>
<p>supersedes, voids, or otherwise alters your Non-Competition and Confidentiality obligations and other covenants contained in your Employment Agreement.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li><p><u>Modification and Waiver</u>. No provision of this Agreement may be amended or modified unless the amendment or modification is agreed to in writing and signed by you and by the General Counsel of the Employer. No waiver by either Party of any breach by the other party of any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by the other Party shall be deemed a waiver of any similar or dissimilar provision or condition at the same or any prior or subsequent time, nor shall the failure of or delay by either Party in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement operate as a waiver thereof to preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other such right, power, or privilege.</p></li>
<li><p><u>Section 409A</u>. This Agreement is intended to comply with Section 409A, including the exceptions thereto, and shall be construed and administered in accordance with such intent. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, payments provided under this Agreement may only be made upon an event and in a manner that complies with Section 409A or an applicable exemption. Any payments under this Agreement that may be excluded from Section 409A either as separation pay due to an involuntary separation from service, as a short-term deferral, or as a settlement payment pursuant to a bona fide legal dispute shall be excluded from Section 409A to the maximum extent possible. Each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided under this Agreement shall be construed as a separate and distinct payment for purposes of Section 409A. Without limiting the foregoing and notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, to the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A: (i) you shall not be considered to have terminated employment with the Employer for purposes of any payments under this Agreement which are subject to Section 409A until you would be considered to have incurred a “separation from service” from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A; (ii) amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Agreement or any other arrangement between you and the Company during the six (6) month period immediately following your separation from service shall instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is six (6) months following your separation from service (or, if earlier, your date of death); (iii) to the extent required to avoid taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A, amounts reimbursable to you under this Agreement shall be paid to you on or before the last day of the year following the year in which the expense was incurred and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and in-kind benefits provided to the Employee) during one year may not affect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year; and (iv) if any severance amount payable under a plan or agreement that you may have a right or entitlement to as of the date of this Agreement constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A, then the portion of the benefits payable hereunder equal to such other amount shall instead be provided in the form set forth in such other plan or agreement. The Company makes no representation that any or all of the payments described in this Agreement will be exempt from or comply with Section 409A and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A from applying to any such payment. You understand and agree that you shall be solely responsible for the payment</p></li>

<p>of any taxes, penalties, interest or other expenses you may incur on account of non-compliance with Section 409A.</p>

For purposes of this Section 7(e), the determination of whichever amount is greater on an after-tax basis shall be (i) based on maximum federal, state and local income and employment tax rates and the tax that would be imposed on Executive pursuant to Section 4999 and (ii) made at the Company’s expense by consultants of national recognition selected by the Company prior to the date of the Change in Control, which determination shall be binding on both Executive and the Company (for clarity and the avoidance of doubt, the calculations with respect to such determination shall consider all mitigating factors such as, without limitation, the value of any noncompetition restrictions to which Executive will be subject to following the Change in Control).

<p>10</p>
<p>state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and (B) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding. Executive understands that if Executive files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, Executive may disclose the trade secret to Executive’s attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if the Executive’s (x) files any document containing the trade secret under seal, and (y) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. Nothing in this Agreement or any other agreement by and between the Company and Executive is intended to conflict with 18 U.S.C. § 1833(b) or create liability for disclosures of trade secrets expressly allowed by such section.</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li><p>Further, nothing in this Agreement or any other agreement by and between the Company and Executive shall prohibit or restrict Executive from (i) voluntarily communicating with an attorney retained by Executive; (ii) voluntarily communicating with any law enforcement, government agency, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the New York State Division of Human Rights or a local commission on human rights, or any self-regulatory organization regarding possible violations of law, in each case without advance notice to the Company, or otherwise initiating, testifying, assisting, complying with a subpoena from, or participating in any manner with an investigation conducted by such government agency; (iii) recovering a SEC whistleblower award as provided under Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (iv) disclosing any Confidential Information to a court or other administrative or legislative body in response to a subpoena, provided that Executive first promptly notifies and provides the Company with the opportunity to seek, and join in its efforts at the sole expense of the Company, to challenge the subpoena or obtain a protective order limiting its disclosure, or other appropriate remedy; or (v) filing or disclosing any facts necessary to receive unemployment insurance, Medicaid or other public benefits to which Executive is entitled.</p></li>
<li><p>Executive recognizes that the Confidential Information has been developed by the Company and its affiliates at substantial cost and constitutes valuable and unique property of the Company. Executive acknowledges that the foregoing makes it reasonably necessary for the protection of the Company’s interests, in view of Executive’s position with the Company, that Executive not compete with the Company or its affiliates during the Employment Period and for a reasonable and limited period thereafter. Therefore, Executive agrees that during the period of Executive’s employment hereunder and for a period of two years thereafter, Executive shall not engage in Competition. As used herein, “Competition” shall mean (i) providing services that are the same as or similar in function or purpose as those Executive provided to the Company at any time during the twenty-four (24) calendar month period immediately preceding the Termination Date (within the United States of America, or in any country where the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates has done business) to (A) a business in competition with</p></li>
</ol>
<p>11</p>
<p>the retail, catalog, or on-line sale of athletic footwear, athletic apparel, and sporting goods conducted by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (the “Athletic Business”) or (B) a business that in the prior fiscal year supplied product to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates for the Athletic Business having a value of $20 million or more at cost to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates; provided, however, that (X) such participation shall not include the mere ownership of not more than 1 percent of the total outstanding stock of a publicly traded company and (Y) a department store or general merchandise store shall not be considered a business in competition with any business conducted by the Company; or (ii) the recruiting, soliciting or inducing of any employee or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates and with whom Executive had dealings during the then immediately preceding twelve (12) calendar month period, but ending on the Termination Date, to terminate their employment with, or otherwise cease their relationship with, the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates where such employee or employees do in fact so terminate their employment.</p>
<ol start="5" type="a">
<li><p>Executive agrees (i) that her services are special and extraordinary, (ii) that a violation of her commitment not to disclose Confidential Information or otherwise to engage in acts of Competition would immediately and irreparably harm the Company, and (iii) that such harm would be incapable of adequate remediation by money damages. Accordingly, Executive agrees that this Section 7 may be enforced by injunction, and that she will interpose no objection or defense to such enforcement. Enforcement by injunction shall not bar the Company from any other legal or equitable remedies to which it may be entitled for such violation. If any restriction set forth with regard to Competition is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it is the intention of the parties that the court should interpret and enforce such restriction to its fullest lawful extent.</p></li>
<li><p>The Company advises Executive to consult with an attorney of Executive’s choice before agreeing to the terms set forth in this Section 9. Executive acknowledges that this Agreement has been provided to Executive at least fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the Commencement Date, and Executive has had up to fourteen (14) calendar days from the date Executive first received this Agreement to consider its terms. However, Executive may sign and return it sooner if Executive wishes. By entering into this Agreement, Executive acknowledges and agrees that Executive (A) has been given the opportunity to seek the advice of counsel; (B) has carefully read and fully understands all of the provisions of this Section 9; and (C) is entering into this Agreement knowingly, freely, and voluntarily in exchange for good and valuable consideration to which Executive would not otherwise be entitled.</p></li>

<p>Dona D. Young to Become Non-Executive Chair, Effective February 1, 2023 Transition Reflects Thorough Succession Planning Process and Strong Governance</p>
<p>NEW YORK, August 19, 2022 – Foot Locker, Inc. (NYSE: FL) (“Foot Locker” or “the Company”), the New York-based specialty athletic retailer, today announced that, as part of a planned succession process, Richard A. Johnson will retire as President and Chief Executive Officer, effective September 1, 2022. Mary N. Dillon, former Executive Chair and CEO of Ulta Beauty, Inc., has been appointed President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Foot Locker Board, also effective September 1, 2022.</p>
<p>Johnson will continue as Executive Chairman of the Board through January 31, 2023, and will step down from the Board at that time, subsequently remaining with the Company as a Senior Advisor to the Chief Executive Officer until early April 2023 to facilitate a smooth transition. The Company’s Board has determined that the Chair and Chief Executive Officer roles will be separated, also effective September 1, 2022, and the Company’s Lead Independent Director, Dona D. Young, will become non-Executive Chair, effective February 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Johnson has had a distinguished three-decade long career at Foot Locker, including having served as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer since 2014 following two years as Chief Operating Officer and holding multiple other divisional leadership roles. During Johnson’s tenure, he has led the development of the Company’s strategic imperatives and long-term plan, overseen sales growth to approximately $9 billion in 2021 from approximately $7 billion in 2014, been responsible for a number of investments and acquisitions, including WSS and atmos in 2021, led Foot Locker’s digital transformation and strategy to expand into new geographies as well as diversify product mix across brands and categories, along with strengthening the Company’s focus on DE&amp;I and ESG initiatives.</p>
<p>“It has been a privilege and an honor to lead Foot Locker and work alongside the best team in retail for nearly 30 years,” said Johnson. “Together, we have built a broad house of brands and banners fueled by a shared passion for the global sneaker community. We have turned a brick-and-mortar company into an interactive retail community poised for long-term growth in the digital era. The Board and I have worked closely together on a thoughtful succession plan, and with a strong foundation in place and ongoing momentum against our strategic objectives, we believe now is the right time to complete the CEO transition. We are confident that Mary is the ideal person to serve as Foot Locker’s next CEO and lead the Company forward. Mary has established a remarkable track</p>
<p>record in the retail industry, and she brings an incredible mix of talent, experience and commitment to take Foot Locker to the next level.”</p>
<p>Dillon said, “I am thrilled to be joining Foot Locker, an iconic company that possesses a strong set of values and focus on the customer experience as well as tremendous growth opportunities. It is clear how Foot Locker sits at the heart of the global sport and sneaker community, and I am excited to become part of the Company’s team. I look forward to working closely with Dick to ensure a smooth transition, and to partnering with the Board, leadership team and nearly 50,000 team members around the world to build on Foot Locker’s strong foundation and help shape the Company’s future.”</p>
<p>Young noted, “On behalf of the Board and the entire Foot Locker team, I extend our deepest gratitude to Dick for his dedication, leadership and outstanding contributions. It has truly been an honor and a privilege serving on the Board with Dick. He has left an indelible mark on the business, organization and sneaker community and we wish him only the best on his well-deserved retirement from the Company and next chapter of his life’s journey. Looking forward, we are unanimous in our belief that Mary will be a tremendous addition to Foot Locker’s dynamic and diverse leadership team. Mary’s experience leading consumer-driven businesses and building robust brand portfolios, along with her commitment to culture, is deeply aligned with Foot Locker’s priorities and strategy.”</p>
<p>Young added, “Today’s Board and leadership transitions are the culmination of a multi-year succession planning process which mirrors our track record of active planning for board succession and adherence to governance best practices. We are confident this will be a smooth transition as the Board and leadership team continue to focus on driving value for all Foot Locker stakeholders.”</p>
<p>Dillon has over 35 years of experience leading consumer-driven businesses in a diverse range of industries, from consumer-packaged goods to restaurants to telecom to beauty and retail. She brings deep consumer marketing and digital transformation expertise, strong operational experience, a proven track record of shareholder value creation and a demonstrated commitment to leadership development. Most recently, she served as Executive Chair of Ulta Beauty, after having served as CEO for eight years, and was responsible for guiding the company as it became the leading beauty destination in the U.S. and a successful omni-channel retailer with a best-in-class loyalty program. This led to revenue CAGR of 16% and the tripling of the company’s market capitalization over her tenure.
